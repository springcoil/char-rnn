1
00:00:25,807 --> 00:00:27,240
(Helicopter)

2
00:00:28,607 --> 00:00:29,756
(Crash)

3
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:36,881
Right. That's Tuesday dealt with.

4
00:00:36,927 --> 00:00:38,758
Let's look at Wednesday now.

5
00:00:38,807 --> 00:00:42,766
Uh... Half-seven Mass.

6
00:00:42,807 --> 00:00:45,196
I can take that.

7
00:00:45,247 --> 00:00:47,761
And, uh...maybe...

8
00:00:47,807 --> 00:00:50,446
Could you take
the eight o'clock at all??

9
00:00:52,647 --> 00:00:54,683
Right, I can take that as well.

10
00:00:55,727 --> 00:00:59,436
Now, um...
the half-six evening Mass on Sunday.

11
00:00:59,487 --> 00:01:01,557
Evening Mass?

12
00:01:03,087 --> 00:01:04,281
Too early.

13
00:01:04,327 --> 00:01:07,603
No problem, I can take that as well,
I'll just make a note.

14
00:01:07,647 --> 00:01:10,002
- Morning, Ted.
- Morning, Dougal.

15
00:01:12,127 --> 00:01:14,163
Uh, Dougal?? There's, uh...

16
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:16,482
There's some shaving cream
just there.

17
00:01:16,527 --> 00:01:18,916
No, there's not, Ted. You're grand.

18
00:01:20,727 --> 00:01:23,036
- No, on you.
- Oh, where, exactly?

19
00:01:23,087 --> 00:01:25,681
- Just there, below your ear.
- Here?

20
00:01:25,727 --> 00:01:28,480
Yes, and there's a bit more...

21
00:01:28,527 --> 00:01:30,961
- Gone?
- No, there's still just a...

22
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:32,645
It's all over the place.

23
00:01:34,887 --> 00:01:37,526
Oh, God. How on earth
did all that get there?

24
00:01:37,567 --> 00:01:39,797
I didn't even shave this morning.

25
00:01:43,967 --> 00:01:46,117
So, what are we doing today, Ted?

26
00:01:46,167 --> 00:01:48,317
Confessions and things like that?

27
00:01:48,367 --> 00:01:50,483
Yes, Dougal, things like that.

28
00:01:52,687 --> 00:01:55,838
It's great being a priest,
isn't it, Ted?

29
00:01:59,167 --> 00:02:00,600
God, it's lovely out.

30
00:02:04,287 --> 00:02:05,845
Oh, wait till I tell you, Ted!

31
00:02:05,887 --> 00:02:08,799
Funland's coming to Craggy Island
on Saturday.

32
00:02:08,847 --> 00:02:10,838
Oh, yes, the fairground thing.

33
00:02:10,887 --> 00:02:14,766
I wouldn't have much interest
in that type of thing myself.

34
00:02:14,807 --> 00:02:17,002
They've got a spider baby.

35
00:02:18,527 --> 00:02:20,199
- A what?
- A spider baby.

36
00:02:20,247 --> 00:02:21,600
A freak show thing.

37
00:02:21,647 --> 00:02:24,878
It's got the body of a spider
but it's actually a baby.

38
00:02:24,927 --> 00:02:26,326
Oh.

39
00:02:29,767 --> 00:02:33,282
How is it a baby?
Does it have a nappy on or something?

40
00:02:34,967 --> 00:02:36,241
No.

41
00:02:36,287 --> 00:02:38,517
Does it have the head of a baby?

42
00:02:40,647 --> 00:02:42,160
Um...

43
00:02:42,207 --> 00:02:43,196
No.

44
00:02:44,687 --> 00:02:48,999
Well, if it looks like a spider
and it doesn't gurgle or anything,

45
00:02:49,047 --> 00:02:50,844
how do you know it's a baby?

46
00:02:51,887 --> 00:02:53,878
They keep it in a pram.

47
00:02:56,967 --> 00:03:00,164
Dougal,
are you absolutely sure about this?

48
00:03:00,207 --> 00:03:03,438
You're not confusing it
with a dream or anything?

49
00:03:03,487 --> 00:03:07,605
No, honestly, I saw it on the news.
Honestly! Oh... Oh, wait now.

50
00:03:07,647 --> 00:03:11,083
Actually, now that you say it,
it was a dream, yeah.

51
00:03:12,607 --> 00:03:15,246
Have you been studying this
like I told you?

52
00:03:15,287 --> 00:03:17,482
Oh, I have, Ted.

53
00:03:17,527 --> 00:03:21,156
Sorry. But we should go anyway, Ted,
it'll be great!

54
00:03:21,207 --> 00:03:24,358
Last year I did horse riding
and it was just fantastic.

55
00:03:24,407 --> 00:03:26,204
I didn't know you rode horses.

56
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:29,603
Well, it wasn't a real horse,
Ted, like...

57
00:03:29,647 --> 00:03:32,480
It was this old fellow
with a saddle on him.

58
00:03:36,167 --> 00:03:38,397
God, he must've been about 80.

59
00:03:38,447 --> 00:03:40,836
Of course, he couldn't go very fast.

60
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,765
I was kind of lashing him
with the whip and all...

61
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:45,684
Couldn't get much of a response.

62
00:03:45,727 --> 00:03:48,366
And how long were you up on him?

63
00:03:48,407 --> 00:03:50,557
Oh, I'd say it was about, uh...

64
00:03:52,087 --> 00:03:54,123
about an hour?

65
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:57,318
So you were up on
an 80-year-old man,

66
00:03:57,367 --> 00:04:00,518
riding him around and whipping him
for 60 minutes?

67
00:04:00,567 --> 00:04:04,446
You realise that image will
stay with me for the rest of my life?

68
00:04:04,487 --> 00:04:08,275
I know, Ted. It's great, isn't it?
Come on, we should go.

69
00:04:08,327 --> 00:04:11,797
No, I don't think I could
take the excitement, to be honest.

70
00:04:11,847 --> 00:04:15,203
Suppose I'll just see if there's
anything on the TV.

71
00:04:18,727 --> 00:04:22,003
- 'What type of a jumper is that?'
- 'Well, basically...'

72
00:04:22,047 --> 00:04:23,275
Ahh!

73
00:04:26,247 --> 00:04:28,203
(Sizzling)

74
00:04:33,447 --> 00:04:36,359
Maybe I'll just go and study
the old diagram.

75
00:04:36,407 --> 00:04:37,920
(Phone )

76
00:04:40,207 --> 00:04:42,402
Hello? Father Ted Crilly speaking.

77
00:04:42,447 --> 00:04:46,725
Hello, Father. Sorry to disturb you.
My name is Terry MacNamee.

78
00:04:46,767 --> 00:04:50,555
I'm producing Faith of Our Fathers
for Telly Eireann.

79
00:04:50,607 --> 00:04:54,236
We're talking to priests
who work in isolated communities.

80
00:04:54,287 --> 00:04:55,879
Would you be interested?

81
00:04:55,927 --> 00:04:59,476
Well, that's very, um...
That's very exciting.

82
00:04:59,527 --> 00:05:02,439
Faith of Our Fathers
is my favourite programme.

83
00:05:02,487 --> 00:05:05,320
Well, you were the first person
we thought of.

84
00:05:05,367 --> 00:05:07,881
If you are interested,
I could come over.

85
00:05:07,927 --> 00:05:09,599
We'd give you a small fee.

86
00:05:09,647 --> 00:05:12,161
- Who's that, Ted?
- Uh, no one.

87
00:05:12,207 --> 00:05:14,596
- No one?
- 'Hello, Father Crilly?'

88
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:16,558
- No.
- Must be someone, Ted.

89
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:18,404
Just a moment.

90
00:05:22,287 --> 00:05:23,515
Sorry.

91
00:05:23,567 --> 00:05:26,035
How exactly do you get to
Craggy Island?

92
00:05:26,087 --> 00:05:28,078
It doesn't seem to be on any maps.

93
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:32,040
No, it wouldn't be on any maps, now.
We're not exactly New York.

94
00:05:32,087 --> 00:05:35,204
The best way is
from Galway, go slightly north

95
00:05:35,247 --> 00:05:38,637
till you see the English boats
with the nuclear symbol.

96
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:43,078
They go very close to the island
dumping the old glow-in-the-dark.

97
00:05:43,127 --> 00:05:47,643
Are there any other priests living
with you? We don't list anyone else.

98
00:05:47,687 --> 00:05:50,520
Um...well, uh...

99
00:05:50,567 --> 00:05:52,762
No, there's no one else here.

100
00:05:52,807 --> 00:05:56,083
I'll see you on Saturday.
I'll call when I get there.

101
00:05:56,127 --> 00:05:57,526
Bye.

102
00:06:00,567 --> 00:06:02,842
(Burps )

103
00:06:17,167 --> 00:06:18,759
The ants are back, Ted.

104
00:06:20,607 --> 00:06:24,441
Never turn on the TV when Father
Jack's asleep. You know how he is!

105
00:06:24,487 --> 00:06:26,717
But he's always asleep.

106
00:06:26,767 --> 00:06:30,476
Anyone who's served the Church
as long as he has deserves a rest.

107
00:06:30,527 --> 00:06:31,721
(Snoring)

108
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:34,759
It's an honour for us
to look after him in his old age.

109
00:06:34,807 --> 00:06:36,684
(Muttering)

110
00:06:37,727 --> 00:06:40,958
Look at him,
dreaming of past glories, no doubt.

111
00:06:41,007 --> 00:06:42,759
(Angelic choir)

112
00:06:42,807 --> 00:06:45,321
Girls, pay attention.

113
00:06:45,367 --> 00:06:47,437
We've got a special treat today.

114
00:06:47,487 --> 00:06:52,003
Father Hackett has volunteered to
take you all for volleyball practice.

115
00:06:53,167 --> 00:06:54,600
Right, Father.

116
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:57,161
He's just reminded me
it's very warm,

117
00:06:57,207 --> 00:06:59,402
so no need for your tracksuit tops.

118
00:07:02,767 --> 00:07:04,280
(Angelic choir)

119
00:07:12,047 --> 00:07:13,878
Hello!

120
00:07:14,927 --> 00:07:16,838
Father Dougal McGuire here.

121
00:07:16,887 --> 00:07:20,118
And welcome to this week's
Top of the Pops.

122
00:07:20,167 --> 00:07:21,600
In at number 45 this week

123
00:07:21,647 --> 00:07:24,400
is Father Ted Crilly
with I've Got the Power.

124
00:07:24,447 --> 00:07:29,760
And at number 15 for the 16th week
in a row is Father Jack Hackett,

125
00:07:29,807 --> 00:07:31,320
with I'm a Sleepy Priest.

126
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:34,484
How did that gobshite
get on the television?!

127
00:07:37,487 --> 00:07:39,876
Hello to you all.

128
00:07:39,927 --> 00:07:42,964
Ah, is the television
broken again, Father?

129
00:07:43,007 --> 00:07:45,646
- Yes, we...
- There's nothing wrong with it

130
00:07:45,687 --> 00:07:50,966
that can't be fixed with a bit of
you know what in the head department.

131
00:07:51,007 --> 00:07:52,759
Now, then, who's for tea?

132
00:07:52,807 --> 00:07:55,924
- Me, please, Mrs Doyle.
- Tea? Feck!

133
00:07:57,167 --> 00:07:59,920
- I'm fine, Mrs Doyle.
- You won't have a cup?

134
00:07:59,967 --> 00:08:02,356
No thanks, Mrs Doyle.
I won't have a cup.

135
00:08:02,407 --> 00:08:05,240
- You sure? It's hot.
- No, I'm not in the mood.

136
00:08:05,287 --> 00:08:08,040
All right, so...
Aw, would you not have a drop?

137
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:09,998
- No, thanks.
- Just a little cup.

138
00:08:10,047 --> 00:08:12,277
- I'm fine!
- I tell you what, Father...

139
00:08:12,327 --> 00:08:14,636
- Seriously!
- I'll pour a cup anyway.

140
00:08:14,687 --> 00:08:17,963
And you can have it if you want.
Now...

141
00:08:19,527 --> 00:08:21,722
And what do you say to a cup?

142
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:23,598
Feck off, cup!

143
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:28,204
- He loves his cup of tea.
- Feck off!

144
00:08:28,247 --> 00:08:29,680
There you go.

145
00:08:29,727 --> 00:08:31,126
Feck off!

146
00:08:31,167 --> 00:08:33,283
Father Crilly, I nearly forgot.

147
00:08:33,327 --> 00:08:36,922
- Earlier, a Terry MacNamee called.
- Oh, right.

148
00:08:36,967 --> 00:08:38,958
- Who's that?
- Never heard of him.

149
00:08:39,007 --> 00:08:41,601
Something to do with the television?

150
00:08:41,647 --> 00:08:43,239
He's coming to fix it.

151
00:08:43,287 --> 00:08:46,085
- He'll be here tomorrow at 12.
- Grand.

152
00:08:50,607 --> 00:08:53,485
Yeah, it's good you
called someone, Ted.

153
00:08:55,567 --> 00:08:57,205
It's still not working.

154
00:08:59,767 --> 00:09:02,201
# You're simply the best

155
00:09:02,247 --> 00:09:03,760
# Doo doo doo doo

156
00:09:03,807 --> 00:09:06,799
# Better than all the rest,
doo doo doo doo #

157
00:09:06,847 --> 00:09:08,041
Ahem.

158
00:09:08,087 --> 00:09:10,157
You frightened the life out of me.

159
00:09:10,207 --> 00:09:12,641
You're doing the old pop star thing.

160
00:09:12,687 --> 00:09:14,723
I was, Ted, yeah.

161
00:09:15,767 --> 00:09:19,316
It was great being on TV today.
I've caught the telly bug.

162
00:09:19,367 --> 00:09:21,198
Well...

163
00:09:21,247 --> 00:09:25,638
Get to bed now and get some sleep,
you don't want to get over-tired.

164
00:09:30,087 --> 00:09:32,442
Did you ever want
to get into television?

165
00:09:32,487 --> 00:09:36,844
Ah, no, I... I wouldn't be interested
in that kind of thing, really.

166
00:09:36,887 --> 00:09:40,323
Right. You wouldn't be
much good at it, actually.

167
00:09:40,367 --> 00:09:41,925
What? Why not?

168
00:09:41,967 --> 00:09:45,880
Well, you're a bit serious.
And your eyes are a bit crossed.

169
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:49,921
They're a bit wonky.
The cameras notice.

170
00:09:49,967 --> 00:09:52,356
I am not cross-eyed, Dougal.

171
00:09:52,407 --> 00:09:53,965
Ah, you're a bit, now, Ted.

172
00:09:54,007 --> 00:09:57,795
Half the time I don't know if
you're talking to me or Father Jack.

173
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,680
Dougal, why don't you just...
get some sleep.

174
00:10:00,727 --> 00:10:03,161
Right. Just have to say
the old prayers.

175
00:10:08,847 --> 00:10:10,997
Our Father, who art in heaven...

176
00:10:15,207 --> 00:10:17,482
(Ted) Hallowed.

177
00:10:17,527 --> 00:10:20,200
Hallowed be thy...

178
00:10:21,407 --> 00:10:22,476
(Ted) Name.

179
00:10:22,527 --> 00:10:25,963
Ah, Papa don't preach...

180
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,925
Dougal, you know you can praise God
with sleep.

181
00:10:30,967 --> 00:10:32,161
Can you, Ted?

182
00:10:32,207 --> 00:10:35,597
Yes, it's a way of thanking him
for a tiring day.

183
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:39,196
God. There's lots of ways
to praise God, isn't there, Ted?

184
00:10:39,247 --> 00:10:43,320
Like that time you told me to praise
him by just leaving the room.

185
00:10:43,367 --> 00:10:45,597
That was a good one, yes.

186
00:10:53,087 --> 00:10:55,317
- Ted...
- Mmm?

187
00:10:55,367 --> 00:10:58,916
- Ted?
- Yes?

188
00:10:58,967 --> 00:11:01,162
(Dougal) Knock knock.

189
00:11:03,647 --> 00:11:07,686
- Who's there?
- Father Dougal McGuire.

190
00:11:07,727 --> 00:11:09,877
Good night, Dougal.

191
00:11:14,087 --> 00:11:17,397
(Ted, quietly) I can hear you
a bit better now, shh, yeah.

192
00:11:19,767 --> 00:11:20,995
You made it, then?

193
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:24,562
I think so. There's no indication
it is Craggy Island.

194
00:11:24,607 --> 00:11:26,484
There's no signs or anything.

195
00:11:26,527 --> 00:11:30,725
Is there a man looking at you with
a T-shirt saying "I Shot JR"?

196
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:36,197
Actually, there is.

197
00:11:36,247 --> 00:11:38,522
Ah, you're here, so, yeah.

198
00:11:38,567 --> 00:11:41,240
What? The line is bad,
you're a bit muffled.

199
00:11:41,287 --> 00:11:44,916
I'm on a portable phone,
you caught me by surprise.

200
00:11:44,967 --> 00:11:47,037
I'm on the toilet.

201
00:11:48,047 --> 00:11:51,244
Right. So, er...
So where can we meet?

202
00:11:51,287 --> 00:11:54,962
Anywhere we can get a few good shots?
Any local landmarks?

203
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,406
- No.
- What?

204
00:11:56,447 --> 00:11:58,517
There are no landmarks here now.

205
00:11:58,567 --> 00:12:00,046
None at all??

206
00:12:00,087 --> 00:12:04,126
No, the island itself is a kind
of landmark. For ships and that.

207
00:12:04,167 --> 00:12:07,955
Head away from it and
you're going in the right direction.

208
00:12:08,007 --> 00:12:10,202
- So, uh...
- There's the field.

209
00:12:10,247 --> 00:12:13,284
Oh, a field. Well, that sounds...

210
00:12:13,327 --> 00:12:16,558
It's not a field, really, but it has
less rocks than most places.

211
00:12:16,607 --> 00:12:20,236
Never mind. I'll meet you
at the field. How do I get there?

212
00:12:20,287 --> 00:12:22,278
Ask Tom there. He'll help you out.

213
00:12:22,327 --> 00:12:24,716
Right, Father. Thanks.

214
00:12:29,487 --> 00:12:31,125
Bird!

215
00:12:34,567 --> 00:12:36,797
(Dougal) Ooooo.

216
00:12:37,847 --> 00:12:39,803
Holy Mary Mother of God!

217
00:12:44,487 --> 00:12:47,797
God, Ted, I'm so sorry.
It was just a joke.

218
00:12:47,847 --> 00:12:51,203
Tr...try to avoid doing that again,
Dougal.

219
00:12:51,247 --> 00:12:53,636
I thought it was really...Herself.

220
00:12:55,287 --> 00:12:59,200
- That's the last thing I need.
- You're right there, Ted.

221
00:13:00,247 --> 00:13:04,445
Anyway, it's time for Jack's walk.
Time for your walk, Father Jack!

222
00:13:04,487 --> 00:13:06,682
(Mumbling)

223
00:13:06,727 --> 00:13:08,763
Off around the cliffs.

224
00:13:08,807 --> 00:13:11,605
Can I bring him to Funland, Ted?
He'd love that.

225
00:13:11,647 --> 00:13:14,719
No, he wouldn't.
Take him around the cliffs.

226
00:13:14,767 --> 00:13:17,520
This time, near the edge,
put on the brakes.

227
00:13:17,567 --> 00:13:19,239
He was lucky the last time.

228
00:13:19,287 --> 00:13:22,962
Right, Ted.
Um, you're not coming yourself?

229
00:13:23,007 --> 00:13:26,204
Ah, no, I think I'll stay here
and pray for a while.

230
00:13:28,367 --> 00:13:30,562
Oh, ho, what are you after, Ted?

231
00:13:30,607 --> 00:13:32,723
I'm not after anything, Dougal.

232
00:13:32,767 --> 00:13:37,204
It's not unknown for members of
the clergy to pray from time to time.

233
00:13:37,247 --> 00:13:39,761
Here we are, Father Crilly.

234
00:13:39,807 --> 00:13:40,922
Get away!

235
00:13:40,967 --> 00:13:45,245
There's nothing Father Hackett
likes more than some fresh air!

236
00:13:45,287 --> 00:13:46,959
- Come on.
- Oh, yeah.

237
00:13:47,007 --> 00:13:49,077
That's it.

238
00:13:50,487 --> 00:13:53,445
- Yeah, yeah, no...
- Ahh!

239
00:13:55,287 --> 00:13:56,606
(Shouting gibberish)

240
00:13:56,647 --> 00:13:57,841
Come on, Father.

241
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:01,243
(Confused shouting)

242
00:14:01,287 --> 00:14:04,279
Oh, now, come on, Father Hackett.

243
00:14:04,327 --> 00:14:07,364
That's it, now, in you go.
Isn't that better?

244
00:14:07,407 --> 00:14:10,479
- Good man.
- This'll keep you nice and warm.

245
00:14:10,527 --> 00:14:14,315
(Mrs Doyle ) Are you all right? Ooh.

246
00:14:21,487 --> 00:14:23,125
(Mumbling)

247
00:14:23,167 --> 00:14:26,477
Bye, then!
Every single day the same thing.

248
00:14:26,527 --> 00:14:29,883
Once he's out, he has a great time.
He loves them old cliffs.

249
00:14:29,927 --> 00:14:34,205
- I'll be off. What are you up to?
- I'll just have a bit of a pray.

250
00:14:34,247 --> 00:14:37,364
All right.
Enjoy the rest of the weekend.

253
00:15:08,327 --> 00:15:11,125
I didn't know
this bloody thing was on here.

254
00:15:11,167 --> 00:15:12,646
Hello, Father.

255
00:15:12,687 --> 00:15:15,485
Hello, Tom. Telly Eireann
lads get here all right?

256
00:15:15,527 --> 00:15:18,246
They've gone to film
a bit of the island first.

257
00:15:18,287 --> 00:15:21,165
- They'll be back soon.
- I'll wait in the field.

258
00:15:21,207 --> 00:15:23,323
- Father!
- Yes, Tom?

259
00:15:23,367 --> 00:15:24,720
I've killed a man.

260
00:15:24,767 --> 00:15:28,965
Did you? We'll talk later, I'm doing
an interview for television.

(PA) 'The child has now been found,

264
00:15:47,367 --> 00:15:49,323
You fat, smelly cow!

265
00:15:49,367 --> 00:15:52,120
Take this. You have a face
like a pair of tits.

266
00:15:52,167 --> 00:15:54,761
Well, at least that's one pair
between us!

267
00:15:56,807 --> 00:15:59,765
- Hello, Mary.
- Ah, hello, Father.

268
00:15:59,807 --> 00:16:02,116
- Hello, John.
- Pack of Toffos, Father?

269
00:16:02,167 --> 00:16:06,524
No, thanks. I have to meet someone.
I'm to be interviewed for television.

270
00:16:06,567 --> 00:16:08,922
- Oh.
- Really? That's fantastic.

271
00:16:08,967 --> 00:16:12,846
You know, Father, I think you'd be
brilliant on television.

272
00:16:12,887 --> 00:16:14,002
Well, thank you.

273
00:16:14,047 --> 00:16:17,642
You'll be more than a match for Gay
Byrne or Terry Wogan or any of them.

274
00:16:17,687 --> 00:16:20,076
It'll take weeks
to get to their level.

275
00:16:21,287 --> 00:16:23,596
But I have to go find this film unit.

276
00:16:23,647 --> 00:16:27,686
They probably want to do a few
close-ups and master shots and that.

277
00:16:27,727 --> 00:16:31,515
Don't want to be late and get a
reputation as a Marilyn Monroe type.

278
00:16:31,567 --> 00:16:34,445
- See you soon.
- Good luck, Father Ted.

279
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:39,281
- Get them fecking Crunchies out.
- Feck off.

280
00:16:39,327 --> 00:16:41,477
(Guitar strumming)

281
00:16:41,527 --> 00:16:43,518

Ted! Ted! Over here, Ted!
Come here and look at me!

285
00:17:01,367 --> 00:17:04,359
Hey, Ted! What are you doing here?

286
00:17:04,407 --> 00:17:07,638
I thought you weren't interested
in this type of thing.

287
00:17:07,687 --> 00:17:10,360
You're supposed to be taking Jack
for his walk.

288
00:17:10,407 --> 00:17:13,126
Well, um...
The cliffs were closed for the day.

289
00:17:13,167 --> 00:17:15,681
How could cliffs be closed, Dougal??

290
00:17:15,727 --> 00:17:17,445
OK, no. It wasn't that.

291
00:17:17,487 --> 00:17:19,318
- They were gone.
- Ah.

292
00:17:19,367 --> 00:17:22,518
The cliffs were gone?
How could they just disappear?

293
00:17:23,207 --> 00:17:24,526
Erosion.

294
00:17:24,567 --> 00:17:26,797
Come off and to the cliffs with you!

295
00:17:26,847 --> 00:17:29,805
There's just another
couple of turns to go.

296
00:17:29,847 --> 00:17:32,077

00:17:55,727 --> 00:17:58,446
Dougal, you're a priest,
show some decorum.

302
00:17:58,487 --> 00:18:00,717
- Wish I wasn't a priest.
- What?

303
00:18:00,767 --> 00:18:04,203
- I wish I wasn't a priest.
- Jack heard you say that!

304
00:18:04,247 --> 00:18:06,397

Ted! Can I have a go on
the Crane of Death, Ted?

307

- The what?
- The Crane of Death.

308

There was a young fellow
killed on it last year.

Look. I'm sick and tired of your...

310
00:18:35,527 --> 00:18:38,280
Ted, a fortune teller!
We'll have one go.

311
00:18:38,327 --> 00:18:41,842
- Don't waste your money.
- There might be something in it.

312
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:44,765
It's rubbish.
How could anybody believe it?

313
00:18:44,807 --> 00:18:47,799
It's no more peculiar than
that stuff in seminary,

314
00:18:47,847 --> 00:18:50,645
heaven and hell
and everlasting life and that.

315
00:18:50,687 --> 00:18:53,042
You're not meant
to take it seriously.

316
00:18:53,087 --> 00:18:55,442
You are so too
meant to take it seriously!

317
00:18:55,487 --> 00:18:57,045
- Are you?
- Yes!

318
00:18:57,087 --> 00:18:59,920
- Heaven, hell and everlasting life?
- Of course!

319
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:04,843
Look, Dougal, if I let you go in,
will you go home after?

320
00:19:04,887 --> 00:19:07,401
- I will, I promise, Ted.
- All right.

321
00:19:10,407 --> 00:19:13,126
- (Tarot reader) Hello.
- Let's go, Ted.

322
00:19:13,167 --> 00:19:15,158
- What's wrong?
- I'm scared.

323
00:19:15,207 --> 00:19:17,277
I'll do it and you can watch.

324
00:19:17,327 --> 00:19:19,761
- Hello there!
- Sit!

325
00:19:19,807 --> 00:19:22,560
- First, cross my palm with silver.
- Silver?

326
00:19:22,607 --> 00:19:25,599
- I don't carry bags of it around.
- Give me a pound.

327
00:19:28,807 --> 00:19:33,244
Now, I'll interpret
one card at a time, please.

328
00:19:33,287 --> 00:19:35,164
Be careful.

329
00:19:37,167 --> 00:19:38,395
(Spooky music)

330
00:19:38,447 --> 00:19:42,645
Um...I wasn't concentrating.
Perhaps I could pick another?

331
00:19:42,687 --> 00:19:45,326
No, this is
a common misunderstanding.

332
00:19:45,367 --> 00:19:48,564
The Grim Reaper doesn't mean death
in a literal sense.

333
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:51,917
Rather, it may mean
the death of an old way of life

334
00:19:51,967 --> 00:19:54,037
and the beginning of a new one!

335
00:19:54,087 --> 00:19:56,362
I know what that is.

336
00:19:56,407 --> 00:19:58,921
It's probably about
a new bicycle lamp.

337
00:19:58,967 --> 00:20:01,197
Another card, please.

338
00:20:01,247 --> 00:20:03,078
(Spooky music)

339
00:20:04,087 --> 00:20:05,964
Is that good?

340
00:20:06,007 --> 00:20:10,239
Well, ah... It will all become clear
at the next card.

341
00:20:10,287 --> 00:20:11,879
(Gong)

342
00:20:13,487 --> 00:20:17,719
This is really weird. There's only
supposed to be one in each pack.

343
00:20:22,167 --> 00:20:24,761
Hello, Tom.
Is Father Crilly around yet?

344
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:26,798
He is, yeah. He's in there.

345
00:20:26,847 --> 00:20:30,157
That's a nasty scar you've got, Tom.
Where did you get that?

346
00:20:30,207 --> 00:20:33,119
I was, uh...in an argument.

347
00:20:33,167 --> 00:20:37,399
- Oh, I hope you won.
- I certainly did.

348
00:20:37,447 --> 00:20:40,007
That's nothing.
I've had worse than that.

349
00:20:41,007 --> 00:20:43,760
Can you believe me own Dad
did that to me?

350
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:46,885
It looks like a face!

351
00:20:49,767 --> 00:20:51,325
(PA) 'Siobhan
to the refreshment tent.'

352
00:20:51,367 --> 00:20:55,042
Where's Father Jack?
It's nearly five, time for his drink.

353
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:58,045
- You go that way, I'll go this way.
- OK.

354
00:20:58,087 --> 00:21:01,443
(PA) 'Siobhan, please report
to reheat the hamburgers.'

355
00:21:01,487 --> 00:21:04,524
Come, now, Father,
we'd better be off. Come on.

356
00:21:04,567 --> 00:21:09,197
Father! Father!
There you are, Father.

357
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,965
We got here at last.

358
00:21:11,007 --> 00:21:13,840
Father, Father. Dead to the world.

359
00:21:13,887 --> 00:21:16,196
You don't know what's going on.

360
00:21:16,247 --> 00:21:18,681
Gin! Vodka!

361
00:21:18,727 --> 00:21:20,763
It's time for your drink, come on!

362
00:21:20,807 --> 00:21:23,480
Ahhh!

363
00:21:23,527 --> 00:21:26,599
Are you lads from...
from the television?

364
00:21:26,647 --> 00:21:29,605
- Well, yes.
- Oh, yes.

365
00:21:29,647 --> 00:21:34,118
- We'll just ask a few questions.
- Am I gonna be on the telly?

366
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:37,716
Well, yes. We'll start
with a history of the island,

367
00:21:37,767 --> 00:21:41,521
then move on to how life has changed
for the islanders...

368
00:21:48,887 --> 00:21:53,403
(Terry ) Father, how would you say
religious beliefs on the island

369
00:21:53,447 --> 00:21:56,837
have been affected by TV
and greater access to the media?

370
00:21:56,887 --> 00:21:59,685
God, no, they're talking to Dougal.

371
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:04,201
- Think, Ted.
- Drink! Drink!

372
00:22:04,247 --> 00:22:06,317
(Ted screams )

373
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:08,676
(Angelic choir)

374
00:22:12,567 --> 00:22:15,604
There I am! It's me, look!
I'm on the telly!

375
00:22:15,647 --> 00:22:19,799
'So, God, does he really exist?
I mean, who knows?

376
00:22:19,847 --> 00:22:25,126
'I don't know. Personally, I don't
even believe in organised religion.'

377
00:22:25,167 --> 00:22:26,964
(Ted groans )

378
00:22:27,007 --> 00:22:29,646

(Groaning)

384
00:22:43,567 --> 00:22:46,764
I can't believe it either,
I'm on the television!

385
00:22:48,407 --> 00:22:51,922
That gobshite again!
Is he never off the air!

1
00:00:04,407 --> 00:00:07,604
Ted, if you had three wishes,
what would they be?

2
00:00:07,647 --> 00:00:10,400
Three wishes? I don't know, really.

3
00:00:10,447 --> 00:00:13,325
I suppose
the first one'd be world peace,

4
00:00:13,367 --> 00:00:16,200
and then maybe an end to hunger

5
00:00:16,247 --> 00:00:18,124
and, er...

6
00:00:18,167 --> 00:00:20,044
(Disco music)

7
00:00:21,407 --> 00:00:25,002
..more money for hospitals
and that type of thing.

8
00:00:25,047 --> 00:00:26,639
Fair enough, Ted.

9
00:00:26,687 --> 00:00:28,996
And what would your three wishes be?

10
00:00:29,047 --> 00:00:31,481
Oh, no, I'm happy enough, really.

11
00:00:31,527 --> 00:00:34,724
- You wouldn't want anything?
- No, I don't think so.

12
00:00:34,767 --> 00:00:37,281
I can't think of anything, anyway.

13
00:00:38,767 --> 00:00:42,157
You wouldn't, say, want a big car
to drive around in?

14
00:00:42,207 --> 00:00:44,198
Oh-ho, wow!

15
00:00:44,247 --> 00:00:46,124
That'd be fantastic!

16
00:00:46,167 --> 00:00:49,477
Driving around in a big car -
that'd be brilliant!

17
00:00:49,527 --> 00:00:51,518
(Panting)

18
00:00:53,767 --> 00:00:55,758
What would be your second wish?

19
00:00:55,807 --> 00:00:58,275
Oh, that'd be fine.
The car'd be fine.

20
00:00:58,327 --> 00:01:02,764
You wouldn't like to be a rock star
or something, like Elvis?

21
00:01:02,807 --> 00:01:04,604
Oh-ho, God, yeah!

22
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:07,798
I'd love to be a rock star
like Elvis or something!

23
00:01:07,847 --> 00:01:09,644
That'd be brilliant!

24
00:01:13,087 --> 00:01:16,124
So, uh, your third wish,
if you had one?

25
00:01:16,167 --> 00:01:17,759
Oh, no, that'd be fine.

26
00:01:17,807 --> 00:01:21,083
If I had a big car
and I was Elvis that'd be grand.

27
00:01:23,367 --> 00:01:25,278
You wouldn't like, say, um...

28
00:01:26,327 --> 00:01:27,760
this cup?

29
00:01:27,807 --> 00:01:29,798
Oh, God, yeah!

30
00:01:30,967 --> 00:01:32,719
I'd love that cup!

31
00:01:32,767 --> 00:01:37,204
If I had that cup and I was Elvis
in a big car, that'd be fantastic!

32
00:01:38,487 --> 00:01:41,399
You've never had
much imagination, have you?

33
00:01:41,447 --> 00:01:43,244
You're right there, Ted.

00:02:39,887 --> 00:02:41,286
No, I'm fine.

38
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,560
Right.

39
00:02:51,567 --> 00:02:54,877
Uh...would you like me
to turn on the television?

40
00:02:56,287 --> 00:02:58,084
No, thanks. I'm fine.

41
00:02:59,487 --> 00:03:00,886
Right.

42
00:03:06,647 --> 00:03:09,764
Have you seen Father Shortall
at all recently?

43
00:03:10,807 --> 00:03:12,035
No.

44
00:03:13,687 --> 00:03:16,042
What would he be?
Would he be 80 now?

45
00:03:16,927 --> 00:03:18,121
Suppose so.

46
00:03:19,727 --> 00:03:23,322
Dougal, you wanted a word? Fair
enough. Won't be a moment, Father.

47
00:03:25,487 --> 00:03:27,398
What's up, Ted? Who's that?

48
00:03:27,447 --> 00:03:30,166
- I had to get out of there.
- Who is it, Ted?

49
00:03:31,247 --> 00:03:34,557
- Now, Dougal, don't overreact.
- Fair enough.

50
00:03:39,207 --> 00:03:40,606
Right...

51
00:03:41,687 --> 00:03:43,484
It's Father Stone.

52
00:03:45,087 --> 00:03:47,647
- Dougal, get up.
- Oh, Ted, no, not him.

53
00:03:47,687 --> 00:03:50,155
- It's him, all right.
- God Almighty!

54
00:03:50,207 --> 00:03:54,644
Why didn't you tell him not to come?
You promised after the last time!

55
00:03:54,687 --> 00:03:57,838
It's like talking to a wall
with a moustache.

56
00:03:57,887 --> 00:04:01,766
Oh, God, I hate it!
Those awful protracted silences.

57
00:04:01,807 --> 00:04:03,525
Why didn't you lie to him?!

58
00:04:03,567 --> 00:04:06,206
I did!
I told him great big massive lies

59
00:04:06,247 --> 00:04:08,761
with feckin' bells hanging off them!

60
00:04:08,807 --> 00:04:10,957
It's like asking the Holy Mother

61
00:04:11,007 --> 00:04:14,716
to stop appearing
to schoolgirls at Ballnspittal.

62
00:04:14,767 --> 00:04:16,280
Oh, God.

63
00:04:16,327 --> 00:04:18,363
- Keep me company.
- No!

64
00:04:18,407 --> 00:04:19,840
- Dougal!
- No!

65
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:22,799
(Ted chuckling)

66
00:04:22,847 --> 00:04:24,326
Back again!

67
00:04:25,367 --> 00:04:27,562
Oh, sorry! You remember Dougal??

68
00:04:28,647 --> 00:04:29,716
Ah, yes.

69
00:04:29,767 --> 00:04:32,520
Yes, you've been coming...
how many years?

70
00:04:33,447 --> 00:04:35,324
- A few, anyway.
- Six!

71
00:04:35,367 --> 00:04:37,358
Six years.

72
00:04:38,327 --> 00:04:40,124
Every summer.

73
00:04:40,167 --> 00:04:43,000
So...what time
are you going back tomorrow?

74
00:04:43,047 --> 00:04:45,038
I might stay.

75
00:04:45,087 --> 00:04:46,805
What?

76
00:04:46,847 --> 00:04:49,805
- I say, I might stay.
- How long?

77
00:04:49,847 --> 00:04:52,520
I don't know. A few weeks, maybe.

78
00:04:53,527 --> 00:04:55,199
A few weeks?

79
00:04:55,247 --> 00:04:57,442
Sorry about that, Ted. Fell over.

80
00:04:58,527 --> 00:05:02,042
Tea, Fathers.
Anyone for a nice cup of...?

81
00:05:02,087 --> 00:05:04,317
Oh, no, it's Father Stone.

82
00:05:05,967 --> 00:05:08,561
Do you not have to get back
to your parish?

83
00:05:09,607 --> 00:05:11,484
No. Not for a while, anyway.

84
00:05:11,527 --> 00:05:13,245
(Chuckles nervously)

85
00:05:13,287 --> 00:05:16,643
Right, it's just that
there's a problem in that...

86
00:05:16,687 --> 00:05:20,441
Dougal and I were going
to do something. W-what was it?

87
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:23,763
- The thing there.
- Yes, what was the thing?

88
00:05:23,807 --> 00:05:25,684
- Yes!
- What was it?

89
00:05:25,727 --> 00:05:28,480
- Er, the thing, er...
- Big thing, it was.

90
00:05:28,527 --> 00:05:30,358
- Oh, er...
- Oh, er...

91
00:05:30,407 --> 00:05:33,638
Er... Holidays! (Laughs )

92
00:05:33,687 --> 00:05:35,678
We're going on holidays.

93
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:40,882
That's fine. I'll mind the place.

94
00:05:40,927 --> 00:05:45,876
Wait! It wasn't holidays, it was
something else we were doing...

95
00:05:45,927 --> 00:05:48,725
that means no one
can stay in the house...

96
00:05:48,767 --> 00:05:50,598
What was it? What was it?

97
00:05:50,647 --> 00:05:53,241
Um... We...we...were going to...

98
00:05:53,287 --> 00:05:55,847
- Dougal??
- Have the paintings re-hung!

99
00:05:55,887 --> 00:05:58,765
Oh, brilliant!
Brilliant memory there.

100
00:05:58,807 --> 00:06:01,082
Have you noticed?
They're all crooked.

101
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:04,039
- What type of an angle is that?
- It's a mad angle.

102
00:06:04,087 --> 00:06:05,805
You can't stay here.

103
00:06:05,847 --> 00:06:11,126
See? You couldn't be here when
people are shifting paintings around.

104
00:06:11,167 --> 00:06:13,158
So, where will you go?

105
00:06:14,447 --> 00:06:17,996
- Hotel, probably.
- That's fine. I'll go with you.

106
00:06:20,327 --> 00:06:24,036
Sorry, Paul, I just have
to sort something out with Dougal.

107
00:06:25,727 --> 00:06:28,844
God... God, think, Dougal, think!

108
00:06:28,887 --> 00:06:30,718
(Gasping and panting)

109
00:06:31,727 --> 00:06:33,877
All right, I'll do the thinking.

110
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:35,883
Ted...Jack!

111
00:06:36,847 --> 00:06:38,200
Oh, God.

112
00:06:38,247 --> 00:06:39,566
If he sees him...

113
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:42,963
Christ Almighty,
I'll have to break it to him gently.

114
00:06:43,007 --> 00:06:48,604
- Look, you take Paul out and I'll...
- You're not leaving me with him.

115
00:06:48,647 --> 00:06:51,115
- Dougal!
- No, Ted, sorry about that.

116
00:06:51,167 --> 00:06:55,319
- I just can't. There's no way!
- Are YOU going to tell Jack?

117
00:06:56,327 --> 00:06:57,999
I'll get me coat.

118
00:06:59,007 --> 00:07:04,127
Paul, Dougal's going for a walk.
Would you like to join him?

119
00:07:04,167 --> 00:07:07,876
- No, I'm fine.
- Are you sure? It's lovely.

120
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,519
No, thanks, no. I'm fine.

121
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:11,797
Dougal wants to show you something.

122
00:07:11,847 --> 00:07:13,838
- It's very important.
- Is it?

123
00:07:13,887 --> 00:07:17,880
Yes, very important. Maybe the most
important thing you'll ever see.

124
00:07:17,927 --> 00:07:19,679
- Yeah?
- Yes.

125
00:07:20,967 --> 00:07:22,844
- Right.
- So you'll go?

126
00:07:22,887 --> 00:07:27,403
No, I'm fine, thanks.
I'll see it again sometime.

127
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:31,486
Well, to be honest,
it's not Dougal, it's that...

128
00:07:31,527 --> 00:07:34,246
there's a fire in the house,
you have to leave.

129
00:07:35,407 --> 00:07:37,204
- A fire?
- Yes.

130
00:07:37,247 --> 00:07:40,876
I didn't want to panic you.
It's small, but it could spread.

131
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:43,236
If you died,
I'd never forgive myself.

132
00:07:43,287 --> 00:07:45,847
You go with Dougal,
I'll fight the blaze.

133
00:07:45,887 --> 00:07:47,639
- Right so.
- You're going?

134
00:07:47,687 --> 00:07:51,475
- Well, yeah, if there's a fire.
- Great!

135
00:07:52,647 --> 00:07:56,117
Don't worry about me,
drop of water'll do the trick.

136
00:08:10,487 --> 00:08:15,083
So, have you seen
Father Shortall lately?

137
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:16,879
No.

138
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:24,364
I, uh...I suppose
he must be about 80 now?

139
00:08:26,927 --> 00:08:28,918
I suppose so.

140
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:36,763
Father...

141
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:38,923
Father, are you awake?

142
00:08:40,767 --> 00:08:42,519
Father...

143
00:08:45,727 --> 00:08:48,400
Father, we have a visitor.

144
00:08:51,127 --> 00:08:53,118
So, how's everything, then?

145
00:08:54,887 --> 00:08:56,479
All right.

146
00:08:57,927 --> 00:08:59,918
(Jack) Feck off!

147
00:09:01,767 --> 00:09:04,122
Bit of a back draught. Nearly out.

148
00:09:20,967 --> 00:09:22,958
Jack gone to bed, then, Ted?

149
00:09:23,007 --> 00:09:25,237
Yes, he was a little tired.

150
00:09:25,287 --> 00:09:27,084
(Muffled yells)

151
00:09:33,967 --> 00:09:37,642
Right. Well, I suppose my bath
will be ready by now.

152
00:09:50,447 --> 00:09:52,165
(Sighing) Oh, God.

153
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:16,765
Can I help you, Paul??

154
00:10:17,767 --> 00:10:19,519
No, fine.

155
00:10:21,327 --> 00:10:25,525
I'm, um...having a bath.

156
00:10:25,567 --> 00:10:27,922
It's just that
I wanted to go to the toilet.

157
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:31,357
Oh. Right, well, go ahead.

158
00:10:45,807 --> 00:10:47,399
(Farts )

159
00:10:56,167 --> 00:10:58,123
(Clock ticking)

160
00:11:03,967 --> 00:11:05,958
Ah, time for bed!

161
00:11:08,047 --> 00:11:09,605
It's only half-seven!

162
00:11:09,647 --> 00:11:13,401
Yes, but I have to be up
at 11 in the morning.

163
00:11:15,807 --> 00:11:18,605
Dougal, you'd better
get some rest, too.

164
00:11:27,087 --> 00:11:29,317
I can't take much more of this, Ted.

165
00:11:29,367 --> 00:11:31,244
I know, I know.

166
00:11:31,287 --> 00:11:35,200
Six years. You'd think that by now
he'd have got the message.

167
00:11:35,247 --> 00:11:38,922
Do you remember that time
we pretended to be in Rome?

168
00:11:38,967 --> 00:11:42,118
Ha. God, yeah, that was amazing.

169
00:11:42,167 --> 00:11:46,365
Anyone else would go "fair enough"
and just not turn up.

170
00:11:46,407 --> 00:11:49,126
But five days in the attic!

171
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:55,885
No food, no water.

172
00:11:55,927 --> 00:11:59,966
Rats everywhere...
If only we'd thought of it this year.

173
00:12:00,007 --> 00:12:02,646
How did you meet him
in the first place?

174
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:06,043
We were introduced
by Father Jim Doogan at a conference.

175
00:12:06,087 --> 00:12:09,204
Doogan came up and said,
"This is Father Stone,"

176
00:12:09,247 --> 00:12:11,078
and ran out of the building.

177
00:12:11,127 --> 00:12:13,687
Just ran straight out
of the building.

178
00:12:13,727 --> 00:12:15,524
So we start to talking.

179
00:12:15,567 --> 00:12:18,764
Well, I start to talking,
you know the way he is.

180
00:12:18,807 --> 00:12:22,686
To break the silence, I invited him
to stay. For something to say.

181
00:12:22,727 --> 00:12:26,879
The next day - the next day! -
he arrived on the island.

182
00:12:26,927 --> 00:12:28,963
God, if he'd only say something.

183
00:12:29,007 --> 00:12:31,999
But he just sits there.
What does he get out of it?

184
00:12:32,047 --> 00:12:35,278
I hope he's gone
before your birthday party, anyway.

185
00:12:35,327 --> 00:12:37,636
Ohh. He'll be long gone by then.

186
00:12:37,687 --> 00:12:39,757
What is it? Three weeks away?

187
00:12:57,927 --> 00:13:01,397
Good God, look at the time.
I'd better be going, Ted.

188
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,802
- Oh.
- Anyone need a lift?

189
00:13:06,887 --> 00:13:09,117
(Ted) Dougal...

190
00:13:14,287 --> 00:13:15,800
(Jack muttering)

191
00:13:19,767 --> 00:13:23,760
(Sobbing) Please, God, please!
Please get rid of him.

192
00:13:23,807 --> 00:13:27,766
I don't care how you do it,
just please get rid of him.

193
00:13:29,887 --> 00:13:33,596
Do you want money? Anything you want!

194
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:37,356
Name any charity.
But please get rid of him! (Sobbing)

195
00:13:49,567 --> 00:13:51,797
Maybe we should go home, Ted.

196
00:13:51,847 --> 00:13:54,839
Think about who's sitting
in the living room.

197
00:13:54,887 --> 00:13:57,481
Oh, yeah.
It's clearing up now, anyway.

198
00:13:57,527 --> 00:13:59,245
(Thunder)

199
00:14:00,647 --> 00:14:05,437
- Windmill thing's blown over there.
- Never mind, just have your go.

200
00:14:05,487 --> 00:14:09,241
- Golf, yeah?
- Oh, God. Ah, yeah.

201
00:14:09,287 --> 00:14:12,916
Crazy golf, Paul,
not exactly the US Masters.

202
00:14:12,967 --> 00:14:15,037
- No.
- Will you have a go, Paul??

203
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:17,726
- Oh, no.
- It's great fun, isn't it, Dougal??

204
00:14:17,767 --> 00:14:19,678
- Fantastic!
- Have a go.

205
00:14:19,727 --> 00:14:22,924
- No, no.
- It's easy now the windmill's gone.

206
00:14:22,967 --> 00:14:26,039
Here. Give it a go,
what's the worse thing can happen?

207
00:14:32,287 --> 00:14:34,801
Oh, God, Dougal. It's all my fault.

208
00:14:34,847 --> 00:14:36,200
Don't be silly, Ted.

209
00:14:36,247 --> 00:14:39,717
So what did you do,
pray for him to be hit by lightning?

210
00:14:40,767 --> 00:14:42,359
No, of course not. I...

211
00:14:42,407 --> 00:14:45,717
I asked Him to intervene in some way,
but this is a bit much.

212
00:14:45,767 --> 00:14:47,758
What are you thinking of?

213
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:52,005
Who'd have thought being hit by
lightning would land you in hospital??

214
00:14:52,047 --> 00:14:55,164
What? What?

215
00:14:55,207 --> 00:14:57,767
Of course it can land you
in hospital!

216
00:14:57,807 --> 00:15:00,446
Well, it's not usually serious,
is it, Ted?

217
00:15:00,487 --> 00:15:04,480
I was hit by lightning a few times,
I never had to go to hospital.

218
00:15:04,527 --> 00:15:07,644
Yes, Dougal, but you're different
from most people.

219
00:15:07,687 --> 00:15:11,680
All that happened to you
was balloons kept sticking to you.

220
00:15:14,927 --> 00:15:17,043
God, I hate hospitals.

221
00:15:17,087 --> 00:15:19,999
Ever notice it's usually
sick people in hospitals?

222
00:15:23,927 --> 00:15:27,442
Ah, yeah. Of course,
you're a goner when you walk in.

223
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:29,796
I'll take my chances
in the real world.

224
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:31,758
I'd never go under the hammer.

225
00:15:31,807 --> 00:15:36,676
Under the knife, Dougal.
Under the hammer is auctioneering.

226
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:38,558
Oh, right, yeah.

227
00:15:38,607 --> 00:15:42,680
Remember that film where your
man's head is transplanted onto a fly

228
00:15:42,727 --> 00:15:45,639
and the fly's head
is transplanted onto the man?

229
00:15:45,687 --> 00:15:49,600
- Oh, yes. What was that called?
- Out of Africa, I think.

230
00:15:49,647 --> 00:15:52,525
You know,
your man has the head of a fly

231
00:15:52,567 --> 00:15:55,286
and he's chasing his wife
all over the place,

232
00:15:55,327 --> 00:15:59,843
she's trying to hide the jam
so as he won't get stuck in it...

233
00:15:59,887 --> 00:16:02,276
- I have to stop you there.
- Yes, Ted?

234
00:16:02,327 --> 00:16:04,079
No reason, I just have to stop you.

235
00:16:05,087 --> 00:16:07,043
There's today's emergency.

236
00:16:07,087 --> 00:16:08,918
What is it today, Doctor?

237
00:16:08,967 --> 00:16:13,279
We don't know. I think it's
a combination of Babycham and Harpic.

238
00:16:13,327 --> 00:16:16,558
Probably all that was left
after the party.

239
00:16:16,607 --> 00:16:20,566
Father Stone's been in a long time.
Do you think he's dead?

240
00:16:22,127 --> 00:16:25,881
- Probably doing tests.
- What sort? General knowledge?

241
00:16:27,607 --> 00:16:29,040
No.

242
00:16:29,087 --> 00:16:31,362
Won't get much from him
in that condition.

243
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,318
No. No, medical tests!

244
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:36,165
So what would he know
about that, Ted?

245
00:16:37,767 --> 00:16:39,758
(Jack screaming)

246
00:16:40,487 --> 00:16:43,843
There he goes.
He can move when he wants to.

247
00:16:43,887 --> 00:16:47,118
Stupid bastard!
You've really done it this time!

248
00:16:47,167 --> 00:16:48,839
You started it, you slag!

249
00:16:48,887 --> 00:16:51,447
The next time, I finish the job. I...

250
00:16:51,487 --> 00:16:52,840
Ah, Fathers.

251
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:54,684
Hello, John. Hello, Mary.

252
00:16:54,727 --> 00:16:58,402
Ah, hello. Well, uh...
What are you doing here, Father?

253
00:16:58,447 --> 00:17:01,007
Um...a friend of ours
had an accident.

254
00:17:01,047 --> 00:17:03,561
- Oh!
- What happened? That looks nasty.

255
00:17:03,607 --> 00:17:07,646
I'm sure it's nothing, Father.
It's just a...headache.

256
00:17:08,847 --> 00:17:11,077
I don't know why I bothered coming.

257
00:17:14,127 --> 00:17:15,276
Is that blood?

258
00:17:15,327 --> 00:17:17,636
Oh, God, no, no!

259
00:17:17,687 --> 00:17:19,325
I don't think so, uh...

260
00:17:19,367 --> 00:17:24,157
I just got a slight nick with a knife
when Mary was putting the bandage on.

261
00:17:24,207 --> 00:17:28,803
- It's, uh...it's not a stab wound.
- Sure, he's fine.

262
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:31,156
You've been
in the wars yourself, Mary.

263
00:17:31,207 --> 00:17:33,641
It's only a sprain, Father,
it's nothing!

264
00:17:33,687 --> 00:17:36,201
I was lifting a bag of coal.
It's not broken.

265
00:17:36,247 --> 00:17:38,636
If it is, sure, what the hell??!

266
00:17:38,687 --> 00:17:41,155
Well, I hope your friend gets better.

267
00:17:41,207 --> 00:17:43,767
(Mary ) Next time
I'll freaking make sure...

268
00:17:43,807 --> 00:17:45,240
Shut up, you bitch!

269
00:17:46,287 --> 00:17:49,006
They're a lovely couple,
John and Mary.

270
00:17:49,047 --> 00:17:50,605
Ah, they are all right.

271
00:17:50,647 --> 00:17:51,875
Ooh!

272
00:17:56,687 --> 00:17:59,565
How much longer
are they going to be in there?

273
00:17:59,607 --> 00:18:03,646
Ted, we hardly even know him.
Does he have much of a family?

274
00:18:03,687 --> 00:18:06,201
Yes, his parents are alive.

275
00:18:06,247 --> 00:18:09,762
And...he has a brother, I think.
A doctor in America.

276
00:18:09,807 --> 00:18:11,206
A doctor, wow.

277
00:18:11,247 --> 00:18:14,159
Hard to believe.
But that used to be quite common.

278
00:18:14,207 --> 00:18:16,562
The favourite son
would become a doctor.

279
00:18:16,607 --> 00:18:19,804
The idiot brother'd be
sent off to the priesthood.

280
00:18:19,847 --> 00:18:22,998
- Your brother's a doctor, isn't he?
- Yes.

281
00:18:24,047 --> 00:18:28,484
- Ah! Doctor, how's the patient?
- Hanging in there. Mostly shock.

282
00:18:28,527 --> 00:18:30,961
- That's not serious.
- It's quite serious.

283
00:18:31,007 --> 00:18:33,680
- Lightning can do a lot of damage.
- Can it?

284
00:18:33,727 --> 00:18:36,764
Yes. His reactions are very poor
at the moment.

285
00:18:36,807 --> 00:18:39,879
He's always had very poor reactions.
That's normal.

286
00:18:39,927 --> 00:18:43,124
Actually, he's not reacting at all
to any stimulus.

287
00:18:43,167 --> 00:18:45,920
Again, I wouldn't worry.
That's always the way.

288
00:18:45,967 --> 00:18:47,685
Look, Father, I'm a doctor,

289
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:51,163
and I know it's not normal
to fail to react to stimulus.

290
00:18:51,207 --> 00:18:53,437
I'm sure it is. Look, look at this.

291
00:18:55,207 --> 00:18:57,038
You see? It's a priest thing.

292
00:18:57,087 --> 00:18:59,726
We have our minds
on more spiritual matters.

293
00:18:59,767 --> 00:19:01,758
So I wouldn't worry about it.

294
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:05,117
Well, no,
I think I WILL worry about it.

295
00:19:05,167 --> 00:19:07,158
Oh, God, OK.

296
00:19:07,207 --> 00:19:09,641
Can we see him?
I'd like to say a prayer.

297
00:19:09,687 --> 00:19:11,996
Yes, all right, Father. This way.

298
00:19:16,647 --> 00:19:21,437
As you can see, we still haven't been
able to remove the golf club.

299
00:19:21,487 --> 00:19:23,205
Why isn't he in bed?

300
00:19:23,247 --> 00:19:27,081
It's hard to get him comfortable
when he's in that stance.

301
00:19:27,127 --> 00:19:30,119
But you're right.
He's been on his feet long enough.

302
00:19:30,167 --> 00:19:32,203
He looks like a trophy.

303
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,566
He does, a bit.

304
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:36,598
Sorry, I only just heard.

305
00:19:36,647 --> 00:19:38,763
Paul! Oh!

306
00:19:38,807 --> 00:19:41,685
Come on, Mrs Stone,
we've got to get him into bed.

307
00:19:41,727 --> 00:19:43,718
Father, would you?

308
00:19:45,807 --> 00:19:49,163
- You must be Father Crilly.
- Yes, I am.

309
00:19:49,207 --> 00:19:52,802
Oh, God bless you, Father,
God bless you.

310
00:19:52,847 --> 00:19:55,315
- Ahem.
- This is my husband, Dermot.

311
00:19:55,367 --> 00:19:58,439
Oh, God, it's terrible, Father,
it's terrible!

312
00:19:58,487 --> 00:20:01,479
God forgive me
for using the Lord's name in vain,

313
00:20:01,527 --> 00:20:03,677
but Jesus Christ, isn't it terrible?

314
00:20:03,727 --> 00:20:05,399
- It is.
- Oh, it is, Father.

315
00:20:05,447 --> 00:20:09,235
It's terrible, terrible. I couldn't
have said it better meself.

316
00:20:09,287 --> 00:20:11,323
Terrible is the word. Terrible!

317
00:20:11,367 --> 00:20:14,120
I tell you,
terrible's too small a word.

318
00:20:14,167 --> 00:20:16,965
Oh, God, Father, it is,
it's too small a word.

319
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:20,283
Look what you're doing to
your mother, you lazy bastard!

320
00:20:20,327 --> 00:20:22,318
You're useless! Get up!

321
00:20:22,367 --> 00:20:25,803
- Mr Stone...
- I'm sorry, him causing you trouble.

322
00:20:25,847 --> 00:20:27,678
God forgive me for saying this,

323
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:30,480
but it'd have been better
if he'd been killed.

324
00:20:31,967 --> 00:20:34,162
And herself all upset.

325
00:20:34,207 --> 00:20:36,163
Jesus, what you must think of him.

326
00:20:36,207 --> 00:20:38,596
And us, for bringing him
into the world.

327
00:20:38,647 --> 00:20:41,400
- Mr Stone...
- I'm for a drink, will you join me?

328
00:20:41,447 --> 00:20:43,677
No, I'll stay here for the moment.

329
00:20:43,727 --> 00:20:46,082
I'm off, then. See you later, right.

330
00:20:46,127 --> 00:20:48,561
- And this is Mummy.
- Hello.

331
00:20:52,247 --> 00:20:54,602
I know what you're up to!

332
00:20:54,647 --> 00:20:59,767
God. You know, Father,
Paul thinks the world of you.

333
00:20:59,807 --> 00:21:03,436
Oh, indeed he does.
He never stops talking about you.

334
00:21:03,487 --> 00:21:07,082
Father Ted says this,
Father Ted says that...

335
00:21:07,127 --> 00:21:10,199
- He worships you, Father.
- Really?

336
00:21:10,247 --> 00:21:14,160
He leaves Craggy Island counting
the days till he can go back again.

337
00:21:14,207 --> 00:21:15,606
Literally! Look!

338
00:21:18,047 --> 00:21:19,241
He has a chart.

339
00:21:19,287 --> 00:21:22,643
And he crosses off the days
as they pass by.

340
00:21:22,687 --> 00:21:25,485
And right down
at the bottom of the chart,

341
00:21:25,527 --> 00:21:27,245
a photograph of yourself.

342
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:28,640
Oh, God.

343
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:31,247
And he does paintings as well.

344
00:21:31,287 --> 00:21:33,198
He did this one for you.

345
00:21:37,047 --> 00:21:39,436
- (Beeping)
- Oh, Lord. Oh, God!

346
00:21:39,487 --> 00:21:41,478
- What is it?
- It's his heart!

347
00:21:41,527 --> 00:21:43,358
Do something!

348
00:21:43,407 --> 00:21:44,681
Oh! Oh!

349
00:21:44,727 --> 00:21:47,287
Oh, Dougal, Dou... Dou...

350
00:21:48,247 --> 00:21:49,885
(Beeping stops )

351
00:21:51,207 --> 00:21:53,846
- Dougal!
- Mrs Stone, come with me.

352
00:21:53,887 --> 00:21:56,924
- I need you to fill out some forms.
- Will he be OK?

353
00:21:56,967 --> 00:21:59,606
We're doing all we can,
but he is quite ill.

354
00:21:59,647 --> 00:22:02,400
- Just hope for the best.
- All right, Doctor.

355
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:04,677
Come on, Mummy.

356
00:22:07,927 --> 00:22:10,157
The old woman knows
it's all my fault.

357
00:22:10,207 --> 00:22:11,560
How would she know that?

358
00:22:11,607 --> 00:22:15,202
They have ways. Old women are
closer to God than we'll ever be.

359
00:22:15,247 --> 00:22:19,525
They don't need the operator any
more, they've got the direct line.

360
00:22:19,567 --> 00:22:21,000
She knows, all right.

361
00:22:21,047 --> 00:22:23,880
Who could blame her for being angry?
It's my fault!

362
00:22:23,927 --> 00:22:25,883
Why did I do it? Oh, God!

363
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:27,519
Please!

364
00:22:27,567 --> 00:22:30,718
Bring him back.
I never meant you to take him away.

365
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:32,883
There was no need for the lightning.

366
00:22:32,927 --> 00:22:35,999
You know I didn't mean that.
That was just silly.

367
00:22:36,047 --> 00:22:38,515
Please, God.
Bring him back and I swear...

368
00:22:38,567 --> 00:22:41,604
We'll look after him.
He can stay as long as he wants!

369
00:22:41,647 --> 00:22:43,603
- Now, Ted...
- Shut up, Dougal!

370
00:22:44,887 --> 00:22:48,721
Please! I swear, I'll look after him
for the rest of my days.

371
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:51,122
Please just do this one thing.

372
00:22:52,527 --> 00:22:55,963
Ah, come on. Please!
Please, I swear...

373
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:57,645
(Fanfare )

374
00:22:58,807 --> 00:23:03,005
Paul! You're back!
Oh, Lord, it's a miracle!

375
00:23:03,047 --> 00:23:04,241
Doctor!

376
00:23:04,287 --> 00:23:07,836
Paul, can I get you anything at all??

377
00:23:08,567 --> 00:23:10,558
No, I'm fine.

378
00:23:13,407 --> 00:23:15,363
(Clock ticking)

00:00:41,407 --> 00:00:43,398
Looks like rain, Ted.

00:00:44,487 --> 00:00:46,478
Come on, Dougal. It's your go.

5
00:00:46,527 --> 00:00:50,406
I must say, Father Hernandez,
it's been wonderful having you over.

6
00:00:50,447 --> 00:00:52,961
But I expect you're homesick
for Cuba.

7
00:00:53,007 --> 00:00:54,884
(Speaking Spanish)

8
00:00:56,767 --> 00:01:00,077
(Translator) 'Yes, my country
is very beautiful.'

9
00:01:01,007 --> 00:01:03,157
(Speaking Spanish)

10
00:01:03,207 --> 00:01:08,725
'But Ted, you have a great life
here on Craggy Island.

11
00:01:08,767 --> 00:01:10,758
'You have two good friends.

12
00:01:11,807 --> 00:01:13,160
'Father Dougal...

13
00:01:14,807 --> 00:01:17,116
'And, of course, Father Jack.'

14
00:01:17,167 --> 00:01:20,955
Yes, but I must say,
I miss the noise and the lights

15
00:01:21,007 --> 00:01:23,601
and the whole buzz of the big city.

16
00:01:25,167 --> 00:01:28,398
'You were in Wexford, weren't you?'

17
00:01:30,327 --> 00:01:33,364
I was, yes.
But Craggy Island has its charms.

18
00:01:33,407 --> 00:01:37,116
The west part of the island was
beautiful. Until it drifted off.

19
00:01:37,167 --> 00:01:39,761
'Drifted off?'

20
00:01:39,807 --> 00:01:42,526
Yes, there was a storm
and it just came loose.

21
00:01:42,567 --> 00:01:46,196
Now we don't have a west side,
just north, south and east.

22
00:01:46,247 --> 00:01:47,839
But it was lovely.

23
00:01:48,887 --> 00:01:50,605
'You know, Ted...

24
00:01:50,647 --> 00:01:55,277
'Your housekeeper is a...
very beautiful woman.

25
00:01:58,927 --> 00:02:02,237
'Sometimes this celibacy
is hard for a man.

26
00:02:05,727 --> 00:02:07,479
'Heh, heh, heh.'

27
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:11,122
Yes, well, you have to take
the rough with the smooth, I suppose.

28
00:02:11,167 --> 00:02:14,477
- Bishop Brennan springs to mind.
- 'Oh, yes?'

29
00:02:14,527 --> 00:02:18,156
Yes, Bishop Len Brennan.
He's our kind of boss.

30
00:02:18,207 --> 00:02:20,198
Apparently, he was, uh...

31
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:23,079
at the old...

32
00:02:23,967 --> 00:02:25,320
himself.

33
00:02:25,367 --> 00:02:27,722
The union was blessed, so they say.

34
00:02:27,767 --> 00:02:29,917
'No.'

35
00:02:31,087 --> 00:02:34,318
A son. He lives in America.
Or so goes the rumour.

36
00:02:34,367 --> 00:02:40,761
Was it Colonel Mustard in the kitchen
with...the candlestick?

37
00:02:40,807 --> 00:02:42,035
What?

38
00:02:43,047 --> 00:02:46,244
Colonel Mustard in the kitchen
with the candlestick.

39
00:02:46,287 --> 00:02:49,279
You have Colonel Mustard.
You showed me earlier.

40
00:02:49,327 --> 00:02:51,318
How could it be him if you have him?

41
00:02:51,367 --> 00:02:53,039
Oh, right.

42
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:56,764
Father Hernandez, your go.

43
00:02:56,807 --> 00:03:01,198
'Yes. I think it was...

44
00:03:03,407 --> 00:03:06,160
'The Reverend Green...

45
00:03:06,207 --> 00:03:09,404
'with the knife...
in the drawing room.'

46
00:03:09,447 --> 00:03:13,281
(Chuckling) Those Protestants.
Up to no good as usual.

47
00:03:14,687 --> 00:03:18,441
What's Father Jack looking at?
What's that you're watching?

48
00:03:18,487 --> 00:03:20,637
- What?
- Is that a film?

49
00:03:20,687 --> 00:03:22,996
- What?
- Isn't that Kiefer Sutherland?

50
00:03:23,047 --> 00:03:25,959
- What?
- Is that Flatliners you're watching?

51
00:03:26,007 --> 00:03:28,202
What?

52
00:03:28,247 --> 00:03:30,920
'Is Father Jack
a little hard of hearing?'

53
00:03:30,967 --> 00:03:32,605
What?

54
00:03:32,647 --> 00:03:35,878
Yes, he gets a kind of waxy build-up
in his ears.

55
00:03:35,927 --> 00:03:38,964
Then we have to syringe them.
It's not very nice.

56
00:03:39,007 --> 00:03:42,044
It's great,
because we're never short of candles.

57
00:03:42,087 --> 00:03:43,315
(Jack) What?

58
00:03:46,287 --> 00:03:49,438
All that was in his head last week.

59
00:03:51,487 --> 00:03:54,285
And there's a few more over there.

60
00:03:54,327 --> 00:03:56,841
We've nearly enough
for a papal funeral.

61
00:03:56,887 --> 00:04:00,482
He's a one-man candle factory.
Aren't you, Father Jack?

62
00:04:00,527 --> 00:04:01,721
What?

63
00:04:01,767 --> 00:04:04,759
To be honest, he can hear well enough
when he wants to.

64
00:04:04,807 --> 00:04:06,126
Watch this.

65
00:04:06,167 --> 00:04:09,000
Father Jack,
would you like a glass of brandy?

66
00:04:09,047 --> 00:04:10,275
Yes.

67
00:04:12,007 --> 00:04:14,237
Oh, you see, he's a terrible man.

68
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:15,686
Brandy! Brandy!

69
00:04:15,727 --> 00:04:19,242
All right, all right. Now, say when.

70
00:04:19,287 --> 00:04:20,766
- What?
- Say when.

71
00:04:20,807 --> 00:04:23,116
- What?
- Tell me when to stop pouring.

72
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,203
Oh, right, you want any more?

73
00:04:25,247 --> 00:04:27,397
- Yes. Yes, yes.
- (Phone )

74
00:04:28,407 --> 00:04:32,400
Hello! Craggy Island parochial house,
Father Ted Crilly speaking.

75
00:04:32,447 --> 00:04:34,915
Hello, Bishop Brennan. How are you?

76
00:04:34,967 --> 00:04:39,324
Yes. No. Ah, right. Good, yes.
All right, of course, yes. Goodbye.

77
00:04:40,367 --> 00:04:44,246
The boss is coming over. He wants
to talk to us about something.

78
00:04:44,287 --> 00:04:47,962
Come on. This is the longest
game of Cluedo I've ever played.

79
00:04:48,007 --> 00:04:50,441
How long are we at it now?
Five hours?

80
00:04:51,727 --> 00:04:55,037
Should there not be some cards
in here or something?

81
00:04:59,407 --> 00:05:00,726
Dougal.

82
00:05:02,887 --> 00:05:04,320
Ted.

83
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:09,920
'Again, I have no words to say
how thankful I am.'

84
00:05:10,967 --> 00:05:12,958
That's a bit ungrateful, Ted.

85
00:05:13,007 --> 00:05:15,077
Don't you worry, Father Hernandez.

86
00:05:15,127 --> 00:05:20,121
'However, I do have some gifts
from the people of my village.

87
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:26,038
'Please, do not laugh at this simple
example of Cuban handicraft.'

88
00:05:27,367 --> 00:05:29,005
It's a video recorder!

89
00:05:30,487 --> 00:05:34,196
'Yes, I'm sorry.
It's a very basic model.

90
00:05:34,247 --> 00:05:37,000
'It has only a three-week
pre-record facility.'

91
00:05:37,047 --> 00:05:39,481
Don't worry about that. It's great!

92
00:05:39,527 --> 00:05:41,757
Thanks very much. It's wonderful.

93
00:05:44,007 --> 00:05:49,286
'And for you, Ted,
I have something...very special.'

94
00:05:52,807 --> 00:05:54,206
Oh.

95
00:05:57,927 --> 00:05:59,645
You really shouldn't have.

96
00:06:03,687 --> 00:06:05,917
You really shouldn't have.

97
00:06:07,407 --> 00:06:09,762
'It is a Cuban fertility symbol.

98
00:06:10,807 --> 00:06:15,198
'I hope it brings you
as much luck as it brought me.

99
00:06:15,247 --> 00:06:19,286
'Yes? Eh? Eh, my friend?

100
00:06:21,207 --> 00:06:22,879
'Well...'

101
00:06:22,927 --> 00:06:25,043
Adios, Ted!

102
00:06:25,087 --> 00:06:27,157
(Booming dance music from car)

103
00:06:31,287 --> 00:06:34,165
Come on, Dougal,
the Bishop will be here soon.

104
00:06:34,207 --> 00:06:36,926
- Do you remember what I told you?
- Huh?

105
00:06:37,927 --> 00:06:41,806
It's very simple. Don't mention
what we talked about last night.

106
00:06:41,847 --> 00:06:43,644
Oh, right, yeah.

107
00:06:44,607 --> 00:06:47,201
What were we talking about
last night, Ted?

108
00:06:47,247 --> 00:06:50,080
You know,
about the Bishop's little mistake.

109
00:06:50,127 --> 00:06:51,765
Oh, right, yeah.

110
00:06:52,807 --> 00:06:55,116
What mistake was that, now, Ted?

111
00:06:55,167 --> 00:06:58,398
- His son. His son in America.
- Oh, yes.

112
00:06:59,447 --> 00:07:02,484
He has a son? In America?

113
00:07:03,527 --> 00:07:07,566
- Yes, well, so they say.
- Right. That's news to me, Ted.

114
00:07:11,807 --> 00:07:15,766
We were talking about it last night,
Dougal. To Father Hernandez.

115
00:07:15,807 --> 00:07:17,126
Who?

116
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:21,844
Oh, right, the Cuban lad. Yeah.
He gave us a video.

117
00:07:23,807 --> 00:07:26,037
- The Bishop, remember?
- Right, OK.

118
00:07:26,087 --> 00:07:29,238
Just forget all about it.
Just do not mention the son.

119
00:07:29,287 --> 00:07:31,517
- Have you got that?
- I have, Ted.

120
00:07:31,567 --> 00:07:34,365
The lights are on,
but there's nobody home.

121
00:07:36,367 --> 00:07:39,040
Father Crilly, Bishop Brennan's here.

122
00:07:39,087 --> 00:07:41,237
Hell's bells! Right, show him in.

123
00:07:41,287 --> 00:07:43,039
Not a word about the son.

124
00:07:45,607 --> 00:07:49,122
Hello, Bishop, how are you?
Come on in, sit down.

125
00:07:49,167 --> 00:07:52,284
Sit down there, Your Grace,
beside Father Dougal.

126
00:07:52,327 --> 00:07:54,397
Mrs Doyle? Some tea, please.

127
00:07:54,447 --> 00:07:56,438
Oh, certainly, Father Crilly.

128
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:28,806
How's the son?

129
00:08:29,727 --> 00:08:31,399
- What?!
- The Son of God!

130
00:08:31,447 --> 00:08:34,405
How's everything
in the world of religion?

131
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:37,564
The world of religion? What the hell
are you talking about?

132
00:08:37,607 --> 00:08:40,246
Well, you know. Mrs Doyle, that tea?

133
00:08:40,287 --> 00:08:42,323
Here I am. Here I am.

134
00:08:42,367 --> 00:08:43,925
Oh, isn't this grand?

135
00:08:43,967 --> 00:08:45,844
I'm fine, thank you, Mrs Doyle.

136
00:08:45,887 --> 00:08:48,447
Will you not have a cup of tea,
Bishop Brennan?

137
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:52,116
No, I want to get right to the point
and get the hell out of here.

138
00:08:52,167 --> 00:08:54,806
- Sure you won't have a cup?
- I'm certain.

139
00:08:54,847 --> 00:08:57,441
- Go on, have a cup.
- No, thank you.

140
00:08:57,487 --> 00:08:59,637
Everybody else is having a cup.

141
00:08:59,687 --> 00:09:02,918
- I do not have time. Now...
- You'll feel left out.

142
00:09:02,967 --> 00:09:05,481
You'll be Bishop Piggy-in-the-Middle.

143
00:09:05,527 --> 00:09:06,801
I am fine!

144
00:09:06,847 --> 00:09:09,281
- Are you sure? Just a drop.
- No!

145
00:09:11,247 --> 00:09:13,966
# Bishop Piggy-in-the-Middle! #

146
00:09:14,007 --> 00:09:16,840
Just say yes, Your Grace.
It's quicker.

147
00:09:16,887 --> 00:09:19,879
- All right, then, yes.
- Ah, grand. So, now.

148
00:09:22,487 --> 00:09:25,047
I hope you're not doing
too much damage here.

149
00:09:25,087 --> 00:09:28,284
Jack? Are you behaving yourself?

150
00:09:28,327 --> 00:09:31,797
- Feck off.
- What did you say?

151
00:09:31,847 --> 00:09:35,681
Your Grace, what brings you here?
Sending us back to our parishes?

152
00:09:35,727 --> 00:09:39,242
Fat chance. You're here
until I tell you otherwise.

153
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:42,836
Do you think I'd let Jack
back into a normal parish

154
00:09:42,887 --> 00:09:45,355
after the wedding he did in Athalong?

155
00:09:46,327 --> 00:09:49,285
- Yes, but surely I'm all right.
- No, no, no.

156
00:09:49,327 --> 00:09:52,603
You are here until all of that money
is accounted for.

157
00:09:52,647 --> 00:09:55,764
- I don't know what happened to it!
- Enough!

158
00:09:55,807 --> 00:09:57,638
You went to Las Vegas,

159
00:09:57,687 --> 00:10:01,282
whilst that poor child
was supposed to be in Lourdes.

160
00:10:03,487 --> 00:10:06,524
And as for this...cabbage!

161
00:10:07,767 --> 00:10:10,725
The mere idea of letting him back
into the real world

162
00:10:10,767 --> 00:10:12,837
after the black rock incident.

163
00:10:12,887 --> 00:10:16,323
- Yes, that was unfortunate.
- Lives irreparably damaged!

164
00:10:16,367 --> 00:10:18,198
They were only nuns.

165
00:10:19,247 --> 00:10:21,124
Nuns are people, too.

166
00:10:21,167 --> 00:10:24,318
My God, the strings I pulled
to not involve the Vatican.

167
00:10:24,367 --> 00:10:26,164
I do not want to talk about it!

168
00:10:26,207 --> 00:10:28,562
I just want this film business
over with.

169
00:10:28,607 --> 00:10:30,120
Film? What film?

170
00:10:30,167 --> 00:10:34,001
This blasphemous film,
The Passion of Saint Tibulus.

171
00:10:34,047 --> 00:10:36,083
Now, His Holiness has banned it.

172
00:10:36,127 --> 00:10:39,437
But a loophole means the bloody
thing's showing in this dump.

173
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:41,717
Oh, yes.
Is it any good, do you know?

174
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:44,565
I don't care if it's any good or not.

175
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:48,395
All I know is we have to be seen
to be making a stand against it.

176
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:52,963
I have been brought back from my
holiday in California to sort it out.

177
00:10:53,007 --> 00:10:55,919
And that's where you
and Larry and Moe come in.

178
00:10:55,967 --> 00:10:58,003
What do you mean?

179
00:10:58,047 --> 00:11:02,802
Well, I know that you couldn't
organise a nun shoot in a nunnery.

180
00:11:02,847 --> 00:11:06,840
But despite that, it's up to you
to make the Church's position clear.

181
00:11:06,887 --> 00:11:10,880
Make a protest at the cinema!
Even you can manage that.

182
00:11:10,927 --> 00:11:12,724
Well, thanks very much.

183
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:16,237
Listen, this is very serious.
Don't make a balls of it.

184
00:11:16,287 --> 00:11:17,686
I'll be in touch.

185
00:11:17,727 --> 00:11:20,958
Your Grace.
This isn't really my area.

186
00:11:21,007 --> 00:11:24,841
Nothing is your area, Crilly.
You do not have an area.

187
00:11:24,887 --> 00:11:29,358
Unless it's a kind of a play area,
with sandcastles, buckets and spades!

188
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:31,967
Now, do what you're told, right?

189
00:11:35,047 --> 00:11:37,038
Bye, now!

190
00:11:39,967 --> 00:11:43,198
Look at this. This is silly.
There's nobody here!

191
00:11:43,247 --> 00:11:45,238
Ladies and gentlemen,

192
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:49,678
we have a treat in store today
for all ye fans of French cinema.

193
00:11:49,727 --> 00:11:51,604
- Is it subtitled?
- Pardon?

194
00:11:51,647 --> 00:11:54,480
Is it subtitled or is it dubbed?

195
00:11:54,527 --> 00:11:55,721
It's subtitled.

196
00:11:55,767 --> 00:11:58,076
Ah, Jesus.

197
00:11:59,727 --> 00:12:01,957
Shall we start the protesting now?

198
00:12:02,007 --> 00:12:03,235
Yes, I suppose so.

199
00:12:03,287 --> 00:12:05,960
Or maybe we should
see a bit of the film first.

200
00:12:06,007 --> 00:12:07,884
No, let's just get it over with.

201
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:11,602
Maybe it's not too bad, Ted.
It could be another Commitments.

202
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:15,959
It doesn't matter, good or bad. It's
the morality we don't agree with.

203
00:12:16,007 --> 00:12:17,838
Right, let's go.

204
00:12:17,887 --> 00:12:19,764
Boo! Boo!

205
00:12:19,807 --> 00:12:21,923
- (Barks )
- Ooh, you bad pup!

206
00:12:21,967 --> 00:12:23,639
Who is that?

207
00:12:23,687 --> 00:12:25,518
- Dirty, filthy beggar.
- Boo.

208
00:12:25,567 --> 00:12:27,717
- Look, you...
- Boo.

209
00:12:28,767 --> 00:12:31,759
Father Ted, Father Dougal!
'Tis yourselves!

210
00:12:31,807 --> 00:12:32,922
Hello, Michael.

211
00:12:32,967 --> 00:12:34,878
- How are you?
- Oh, I'm grand.

212
00:12:34,927 --> 00:12:39,159
How's Father Jack? We haven't seen
him since the Sharon Stone season.

213
00:12:39,207 --> 00:12:42,119
He's grand. A bit tired,
so he won't be along today.

214
00:12:42,167 --> 00:12:44,237
Oh, you're making a fierce racket.

215
00:12:44,287 --> 00:12:45,606
It's a long story.

216
00:12:45,647 --> 00:12:48,559
We have the Bishop over,
you know, Len Brennan.

217
00:12:48,607 --> 00:12:50,757
Oh, that gobshite.

218
00:12:50,807 --> 00:12:52,763
Yes, he's gone mad over the film.

219
00:12:52,807 --> 00:12:54,923
He told us
to kick up a bit of a fuss.

220
00:12:54,967 --> 00:12:57,003
Oh, right. Only one thing, though.

221
00:12:57,047 --> 00:13:00,164
You're sort of, uh...
disrupting the show.

222
00:13:00,207 --> 00:13:03,483
We're not, are we?
Awfully sorry, Michael.

223
00:13:03,527 --> 00:13:07,281
Oh, no. No trouble at all.
But if you could keep it down.

224
00:13:07,327 --> 00:13:10,763
I mean,
we have to think of other people.

225
00:13:10,807 --> 00:13:12,763
- No problem.
- Count on us.

226
00:13:13,767 --> 00:13:15,405
Michael, Michael. Um...

227
00:13:15,447 --> 00:13:18,245
I don't suppose you...
You could throw us out?

228
00:13:18,287 --> 00:13:21,040
- Just for the television.
- No problem.

229
00:13:21,087 --> 00:13:22,566
Do you want to go now?

230
00:13:22,607 --> 00:13:25,758
Actually, we might as well stay
and see the film first.

231
00:13:25,807 --> 00:13:28,162
So I'll...throw ye out
after the film.

232
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:29,845
Grand, grand.

233
00:13:29,887 --> 00:13:33,004
And we're still OK
for the, um...half price?

234
00:13:33,047 --> 00:13:36,084
No problem. Enjoy the film.

235
00:13:38,367 --> 00:13:40,358
- Boo!
- Now, you!

236
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,642
What was all that about?

237
00:13:48,687 --> 00:13:51,520
You're asking the wrong person
there, Ted.

238
00:13:51,567 --> 00:13:53,797
I couldn't make head nor tail of it.

239
00:13:54,847 --> 00:13:58,237
I know for a fact Saint Tibulus
wore more clothes than that.

240
00:13:58,287 --> 00:14:02,166
He was from Norway or somewhere.
He'd have frozen to death!

241
00:14:03,207 --> 00:14:07,678
And when Saint Tibulus tried to take
that banana off the other lad?

242
00:14:07,727 --> 00:14:10,195
That wasn't a banana, Dougal.

243
00:14:11,727 --> 00:14:13,718
Anyway, let's get some sleep.

244
00:14:16,807 --> 00:14:22,757
(Dougal) Give us a B, please, Bob...
Beethoven.

245
00:14:22,807 --> 00:14:26,561
Give us a C, please, Bob...
Carnivorous.

246
00:14:28,087 --> 00:14:31,124
- F, please, Bob.
- Oh, God.

247
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:33,362
Not Blockbusters again!

248
00:14:33,407 --> 00:14:34,999
(Dougal) Fettucine.

249
00:14:35,047 --> 00:14:36,480
(Birds chirping)

250
00:14:36,527 --> 00:14:40,805
6am. Great!
Another eight hours' sleep.

251
00:14:44,567 --> 00:14:46,285
You awake, Ted?

252
00:14:46,327 --> 00:14:49,478
- Huh?
- This is fantastic, isn't it?

253
00:14:49,527 --> 00:14:52,963
- Another great lie-in for the lads.
- It is.

254
00:14:53,007 --> 00:14:55,521
Do you know what would be terrible?

255
00:14:55,567 --> 00:14:59,924
If Bishop Brennan told us to
go to the cinema and protest again.

256
00:14:59,967 --> 00:15:01,195
(Thunderclap )

257
00:15:07,607 --> 00:15:09,040
This is ridiculous.

258
00:15:09,087 --> 00:15:12,636
The flipping place doesn't open
for another seven hours.

259
00:15:12,687 --> 00:15:16,600
Now, didn't the Bishop want us
to chain ourselves to the railings?

260
00:15:16,647 --> 00:15:18,444
How are we supposed to do that?

261
00:15:18,487 --> 00:15:20,637
O'Learys might have something.

262
00:15:20,687 --> 00:15:22,643
Right, you go get something.

263
00:15:22,687 --> 00:15:26,885
I'll guard a closed cinema against
anyone wanting to watch a film

264
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:29,282
that doesn't start for seven hours.

265
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:36,600
Jack! What the hell are you up to?
Why aren't you at the film?

266
00:15:36,647 --> 00:15:38,080
Feck off!

267
00:15:38,127 --> 00:15:41,119
What? What did you say?

268
00:15:44,407 --> 00:15:48,400
Listen, did you see my bag anywhere,
my travelling bag, hm?

269
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:51,996
Well, if you do see it,
would you give it back to me?

270
00:15:52,047 --> 00:15:54,925
It's got my bloody passport in it,
and uh...

271
00:15:54,967 --> 00:15:56,764
everything.

272
00:15:58,247 --> 00:15:59,726
Right.

273
00:16:01,767 --> 00:16:03,564
(Mumbling)

274
00:16:24,087 --> 00:16:26,078
( # Hallelujah Chorus )

275
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:33,404
Are you gonna stand there all day,
you fat old bitch?

276
00:16:33,447 --> 00:16:36,757
Don't talk to me like that,
you big pile of shite.

277
00:16:38,007 --> 00:16:39,804
You ignorant prick!

278
00:16:39,847 --> 00:16:42,680
- You watch your mouth!
- I'll watch nothing!

279
00:16:42,727 --> 00:16:44,365
I'll stick this up your ass!

280
00:16:44,407 --> 00:16:47,240
Ah, Father Dougal.

281
00:16:47,287 --> 00:16:48,402
Hello, you two.

282
00:16:48,447 --> 00:16:51,996
- Father, how's tricks?
- We haven't seen you in a while.

283
00:16:52,047 --> 00:16:54,800
We were just making tea.
Will you have a drop?

284
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,281
No, thanks, Mrs O'Leary, I'm fine.

285
00:16:57,327 --> 00:16:59,682
Well, what can we do you for, Father?

286
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:02,605
Well, I was looking for
a pair of handcuffs.

287
00:17:03,887 --> 00:17:06,879
A pair of handcuffs?
What do you need them for?

288
00:17:06,927 --> 00:17:09,077
Nothing much.
They're for me and Ted.

289
00:17:09,127 --> 00:17:11,436
You and Father Ted?

290
00:17:11,487 --> 00:17:14,047
Yeah.
We're just trying something out.

291
00:17:14,087 --> 00:17:17,363
Well, actually, funny enough,
we do have a pair.

292
00:17:17,407 --> 00:17:20,160
Sergeant Thornton left them
when he retired.

293
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:21,765
Retired from what?

294
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:23,286
From the police.

295
00:17:23,327 --> 00:17:26,683
The police?
Was Sergeant Thornton a policeman?

296
00:17:27,727 --> 00:17:29,638
Um...he was, yes.

297
00:17:29,687 --> 00:17:32,076
Why do you think he wore the uniform?

298
00:17:32,127 --> 00:17:34,322
I thought he was just
having a laugh.

299
00:17:34,367 --> 00:17:37,723
Anyway, here's the handcuffs.

300
00:17:37,767 --> 00:17:40,406
OK, thanks, great, great. Bye, now!

301
00:17:40,447 --> 00:17:41,766
Bye, Father!

302
00:17:41,807 --> 00:17:44,605
- Down with this sort of thing!
- Careful, now.

303
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:47,878
- Down with this sort of thing!
- Hello, Father Crilly.

304
00:17:47,927 --> 00:17:49,599
- Hello, Jim.
- Hello.

305
00:17:49,647 --> 00:17:51,763
I seen your picture in the paper.

306
00:17:51,807 --> 00:17:53,525
- What?
- Here, have a look!

307
00:17:53,567 --> 00:17:56,001
(Ted) Look at you!

308
00:17:56,047 --> 00:17:58,515
So it's a blasphemous film, is it?

309
00:17:58,567 --> 00:18:00,922
- Oh, it is.
- What type of thing is it?

310
00:18:00,967 --> 00:18:03,879
- Mad stuff.
- Very immoral. You wouldn't like it.

311
00:18:03,927 --> 00:18:06,441
Is it a type of nudie thing, Father?

312
00:18:06,487 --> 00:18:09,285
You wouldn't believe
the amount of nudity in it.

313
00:18:09,327 --> 00:18:12,763
Do you see the lot, do you,
or is it just the top half you see?

314
00:18:12,807 --> 00:18:16,516
- Nothing is left to the imagination.
- Right.

315
00:18:16,567 --> 00:18:19,320
- Well, I'll be off.
- Goodbye, Jim!

316
00:18:20,927 --> 00:18:24,317
- Hello, Fathers.
- Hello Mrs Sheridan, Mrs Glynn.

317
00:18:24,367 --> 00:18:26,927
The Passion of Saint Tibulus,
what's that?

318
00:18:26,967 --> 00:18:30,642
- We always go on Tuesdays.

319
00:18:30,687 --> 00:18:32,279
Oh, we saw a great one.

320
00:18:32,327 --> 00:18:34,761
- The Crying Game.
- It was brilliant!

321
00:18:34,807 --> 00:18:36,399
There was this great bit.

322
00:18:36,447 --> 00:18:40,486
There was this girl,
then you find out it's really a man!

323
00:18:40,527 --> 00:18:42,916
- They got his lad out.
- What?

324
00:18:42,967 --> 00:18:46,004
You only see it for a second
but you get the message.

325
00:18:46,047 --> 00:18:49,323
I didn't know what it was,
it's so long since I've seen one.

326
00:18:49,367 --> 00:18:51,085
It was like your Billy's!

327
00:18:51,127 --> 00:18:54,563
Not at all.
Billy's is rounder at the top.

328
00:18:54,607 --> 00:18:56,643
Cheerio, Fathers.

329
00:18:58,407 --> 00:19:00,637
Should we be stopping them going in?

330
00:19:00,687 --> 00:19:03,997
Just goes to show,
nobody heeds what the Church says.

331
00:19:04,047 --> 00:19:06,800
- Hello, Pat.
- Father Crilly. Hello.

332
00:19:06,847 --> 00:19:08,917
How's your wife? I hear she's unwell.

333
00:19:08,967 --> 00:19:10,764
She's dead, Father.

334
00:19:10,807 --> 00:19:13,241
That's terrible. When did she...?

335
00:19:13,287 --> 00:19:16,279
- Ah, just a couple of hours ago.
- Really?

336
00:19:16,327 --> 00:19:17,726
Yes.

337
00:19:17,767 --> 00:19:20,759
Anyway, that's just the way it is.

338
00:19:20,807 --> 00:19:23,685
- What's the film like, Father?
- What?

339
00:19:23,727 --> 00:19:26,639
Is it any good?
I was reading about it in the paper.

340
00:19:26,687 --> 00:19:29,963
You shouldn't think about the film
if your wife just died.

341
00:19:30,007 --> 00:19:31,998
I might wander in.

342
00:19:34,127 --> 00:19:37,358
I'll contact you
about the funeral details later.

343
00:19:37,407 --> 00:19:41,320
Good Fathers, I must say,
this is extraordinary.

344
00:19:41,367 --> 00:19:43,927
Our most successful film
since Jurassic Park!

345
00:19:43,967 --> 00:19:48,597
It's breaking records, due to all
this publicity over your protest.

346
00:19:48,647 --> 00:19:50,319
We didn't plan it that way.

347
00:19:50,367 --> 00:19:52,198
Oh, my God. Look who it is!

348
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:58,881
Thank God, a bit of support.
Fair play to you for turning...

349
00:19:58,927 --> 00:20:02,476
Come on, Father. I'll get you a seat
right at the front!

350
00:20:04,607 --> 00:20:07,838
Right, Dougal. I've had enough.
We're leaving.

351
00:20:07,887 --> 00:20:09,764
Give me the keys.

352
00:20:11,807 --> 00:20:13,604
Keys?

353
00:20:18,167 --> 00:20:19,964
What's this, then, Your Grace?

354
00:20:20,007 --> 00:20:22,567
Why am I looking at
a globe of the world?

355
00:20:22,607 --> 00:20:24,438
Well, how can I explain?

356
00:20:24,487 --> 00:20:28,526
Firstly, a resum
of the last few days.

357
00:20:28,567 --> 00:20:31,639
Now, I don't know if you remember,
but I came in here

358
00:20:31,687 --> 00:20:35,521
with the idea of you making
a dignified protest about this film.

359
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,683
- Do you remember that?
- Yes, yes.

360
00:20:37,727 --> 00:20:40,480
Just to show the Church's opposition
to the film.

361
00:20:40,527 --> 00:20:44,884
But - and this is the part that
I find most interesting -

362
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:49,762
you've actually made this film the
most successful film ever shown here.

363
00:20:49,807 --> 00:20:52,116
- Isn't that great?
- Um...

364
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:55,921
I mean, people are coming from all
over the country to see the film!

365
00:20:55,967 --> 00:20:59,323
They're even coming from Gdansk
to see the film.

366
00:20:59,367 --> 00:21:01,642
And look at this! Look!

367
00:21:01,687 --> 00:21:03,882
There's you, there's Forrest Gump,

368
00:21:03,927 --> 00:21:08,079
and there's Father Jack
actually watching the film!

369
00:21:08,127 --> 00:21:10,880
Now, there's a turn-up
for the books, what?

370
00:21:10,927 --> 00:21:13,521
(Laughing) Right! Now...

371
00:21:13,567 --> 00:21:17,003
I think it's best for ye three
to continue your careers

372
00:21:17,047 --> 00:21:20,801
as priests-cum-film promoters
outside of my jurisdiction.

373
00:21:20,847 --> 00:21:22,439
Huh? Now, Ted...

374
00:21:22,487 --> 00:21:25,877
I thought that you
might like to go to America, hmm?

375
00:21:25,927 --> 00:21:27,599
What part, do you think?

376
00:21:27,647 --> 00:21:30,320
Well, um...Las Vegas?

377
00:21:31,247 --> 00:21:34,239
Oh, I'm sorry, Ted.
I meant South America.

378
00:21:34,287 --> 00:21:38,485
There's a lovely little island
off the coast of Surinam and...

379
00:21:38,527 --> 00:21:40,119
(Laughing)

380
00:21:40,167 --> 00:21:44,046
They have a couple of tribes there,
you're going to love this.

381
00:21:44,087 --> 00:21:48,126
And they have been knocking the shit
out of each other since 1907.

382
00:21:48,167 --> 00:21:50,476
And we've never found the right man

383
00:21:50,527 --> 00:21:54,520
to bring them together
in the spirit of Christian harmony.

384
00:21:54,567 --> 00:21:56,956
But I think that you are the man.

385
00:21:57,007 --> 00:21:59,362
- Well, thanks...
- No need to thank me.

386
00:21:59,407 --> 00:22:02,638
By the way,
do you know how to make arrows?

387
00:22:02,687 --> 00:22:06,077
- No.
- Not to worry. It'll come to you.

388
00:22:06,127 --> 00:22:08,322
Now, Dougal, over to you.

389
00:22:08,367 --> 00:22:12,326
Isn't it funny how some of these
places in the Philippines

390
00:22:12,367 --> 00:22:15,279
can keep going
without a proper sewerage system?

391
00:22:15,327 --> 00:22:17,477
- Hmm?
- You're right, Your Honour.

392
00:22:17,527 --> 00:22:19,961
Now, Jack, where can we send you?

393
00:22:20,007 --> 00:22:21,804
Huh? Jack, wake up.

394
00:22:21,847 --> 00:22:25,760
- Bishop, I wouldn't do that.
- You shut up. Jack! Wake up!

395
00:22:26,327 --> 00:22:27,919
Feck off!

396
00:22:29,407 --> 00:22:31,796
I've got you now, Jack! I've got you!

397
00:22:31,847 --> 00:22:36,637
Oh, my God. If you think this is bad,
wait till you see your new parish!

398
00:22:36,687 --> 00:22:38,917
Just wait until you see!

399
00:22:40,447 --> 00:22:43,007
Well, that's it, then.

400
00:22:43,047 --> 00:22:46,437
I suppose...
I suppose all we can do now is pack.

401
00:22:47,527 --> 00:22:50,041
Ted, I don't want to go
to the Philippines.

402
00:22:50,087 --> 00:22:52,362
I can't even spell the Philippines.

403
00:22:52,407 --> 00:22:54,443
I know it begins with an "F" but...

404
00:22:54,487 --> 00:22:58,162
I know. If only we could persuade
the Bishop to change his mind.

405
00:22:58,207 --> 00:23:02,120
If only we had something
we could bargain with. I don't know.

406
00:23:04,087 --> 00:23:06,521
(Ted) What's that?
Did you get a film?

407
00:23:06,567 --> 00:23:08,876
The last thing I want to watch
is a film.

408
00:23:15,887 --> 00:23:17,843
'Shut that thing off.'

409
00:23:20,207 --> 00:23:21,720
# Here I come #

410
00:23:34,207 --> 00:23:37,597
Well. That was great, wasn't it?

411
00:23:37,647 --> 00:23:39,797
You're right there, Ted.

412
00:23:39,847 --> 00:23:44,079
Should we phone him now
or will we watch it again?

413
00:23:44,127 --> 00:23:46,436
I think we'll watch it again.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>
1
00:00:25,447 --> 00:00:27,278
(Helicopter)

2
00:00:28,887 --> 00:00:30,400
(Crash)

3
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:33,644
- Ready when you are, Ted.

4
00:00:33,687 --> 00:00:36,281
You'll like this. Ok. Here I come!

5
00:00:41,767 --> 00:00:44,759
Who are you supposed to be, Ted?

6
00:00:44,807 --> 00:00:47,958
What are you doing?
You two can't go as Elvis.

7
00:00:48,007 --> 00:00:51,044
You... Wait a second.

8
00:00:51,087 --> 00:00:53,078
You're Elvis as well.

9
00:00:53,127 --> 00:00:57,405
Of course. I've got Elvis written
on my back. I don't believe this.

10
00:00:57,447 --> 00:01:01,042
Bit of a coincidence.
Great minds think alike, I suppose.

11
00:01:01,087 --> 00:01:04,636
I've been saying for two weeks
I was going as Elvis.

12
00:01:04,687 --> 00:01:07,201
That's probably where I got the idea.

13
00:01:07,247 --> 00:01:11,445
Great. The first All Priests Stars
in Their Eyes Lookalike Competition

14
00:01:11,487 --> 00:01:13,478
I thought I had a chance in.

15
00:01:13,527 --> 00:01:16,803
I even made space for the trophy
beside the one we got

16
00:01:16,847 --> 00:01:19,884
- for the ludo championships.
- You might win.

17
00:01:19,927 --> 00:01:22,566
If you're on before me,
I'll look an idiot.

18
00:01:22,607 --> 00:01:24,563
Everyone'll think I copied you.

19
00:01:24,607 --> 00:01:29,522
Well, to be fair, it is a bit weird
you happened to think of it as well.

20
00:01:30,527 --> 00:01:34,520
Right. I'll just have to go
as Mother Teresa again.

21
00:01:36,167 --> 00:01:38,886
Who are you supposed to be?

22
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:42,881
Elvis. I'm Elvis.

23
00:01:42,927 --> 00:01:46,317
- I'm Elvis.
- I know you're Elvis, Father.

24
00:01:46,367 --> 00:01:48,642
We're all Elvis. That's the problem.

25
00:01:48,687 --> 00:01:52,043
- Tea, Fathers.
- Feck off!

26
00:01:52,087 --> 00:01:55,238
There's nothing like a cup
of tea in the afternoon.

27
00:01:55,287 --> 00:01:58,324
You look a bit different, Father.

28
00:01:58,367 --> 00:02:00,881
Have you had a haircut or something?

29
00:02:00,927 --> 00:02:02,963
No. I'm Elvis Presley.

30
00:02:03,007 --> 00:02:06,636
Are you, Father? That's a turn-up
for the books anyway.

31
00:02:06,687 --> 00:02:08,837
It's for the Lookalike Show.

32
00:02:08,887 --> 00:02:12,675
Now I see. I must say
I'm looking forward to that.

33
00:02:12,727 --> 00:02:15,525
- Is Father kiernan coming?
- He won't be, no.

34
00:02:15,567 --> 00:02:19,196
He's a great laugh. I remember him
last year telling his stories.

35
00:02:19,247 --> 00:02:23,126
He had me in stitches. It is true
what they say about chubby men.

36
00:02:23,167 --> 00:02:27,604
They are jollier than the rest of us.
They've a way of looking at things.

37
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,239
He shot himself.

38
00:02:29,287 --> 00:02:32,563
Did he? Yeah. That's terrible.

39
00:02:32,607 --> 00:02:36,156
Still, I suppose that's
often the way with fat men.

40
00:02:36,207 --> 00:02:39,324
They laugh to hide the tears.
But that's life.

41
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:44,077
Happy one minute, and the next you go
and shoot yourself and that's that.

42
00:02:44,127 --> 00:02:45,845
Anyway, tea.

43
00:02:45,887 --> 00:02:47,878
(Phone )

44
00:02:51,367 --> 00:02:54,086
- Hello.
- Ted, how are you? Dick Byrne here.

45
00:02:54,127 --> 00:02:56,561
Hello, Dick. How are things?

46
00:02:56,607 --> 00:02:59,724
- Fine. All set for tomorrow?
- The competition?

47
00:02:59,767 --> 00:03:03,646
- What have you planned?
- Ah. I shouldn't say.

48
00:03:03,687 --> 00:03:06,247
- Mother Teresa.
- No.

49
00:03:06,287 --> 00:03:08,562
I think you have a chance this year.

50
00:03:08,607 --> 00:03:10,916
Oh, well. Do you really?

51
00:03:10,967 --> 00:03:12,923
No!

52
00:03:13,887 --> 00:03:15,161
Who was that, Dick?

53
00:03:15,207 --> 00:03:18,005
Dougal, I'm asking again,
don't go as Elvis.

54
00:03:18,047 --> 00:03:20,800
- What?
- I've been looking forward to this.

55
00:03:20,847 --> 00:03:22,565
I know all the moves.

56
00:03:22,607 --> 00:03:24,643
- Remember who's judging.
- Who?

57
00:03:24,687 --> 00:03:28,999
- Henry Sellers.
- No. He's coming here. Wow!

58
00:03:29,047 --> 00:03:31,959
I told you. Father Dunne
is bringing him over.

59
00:03:32,007 --> 00:03:33,918
I've never met a celebrity.

60
00:03:33,967 --> 00:03:35,923
- You met the Pope.
- Did I?

61
00:03:35,967 --> 00:03:39,039
Don't you remember?
When we were in Rome.

62
00:03:39,087 --> 00:03:43,046
That was the Pope? That fella
living in the art gallery?

63
00:03:43,087 --> 00:03:44,759
The Vatican, Dougal.

64
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:48,277
I wouldn't say he's
a celebrity in the true sense.

65
00:03:48,327 --> 00:03:51,285
The Pope is God's
representative on Earth.

66
00:03:51,327 --> 00:03:52,999
You'd think he'd be taller.

67
00:03:53,047 --> 00:03:55,197
What, like a giant?

68
00:03:55,247 --> 00:03:57,556
Still, Henry Sellers coming here.

69
00:03:57,607 --> 00:03:58,960
(Laughs hysterically)

70
00:03:59,007 --> 00:04:02,716
- Henry Sellers coming here.
- Dougal! Calm down.

71
00:04:02,767 --> 00:04:06,043
We've to concentrate
on the Elvis problem. Look.

72
00:04:06,087 --> 00:04:08,999
We'll toss for it.
Whoever wins can go as Elvis.

73
00:04:09,047 --> 00:04:10,719
Ok. All right.

74
00:04:10,767 --> 00:04:12,962
Right, heads or tails?

75
00:04:15,087 --> 00:04:17,078
Heads. No, tails.

76
00:04:17,127 --> 00:04:18,845
Heads. Tails. Heads.

77
00:04:18,887 --> 00:04:22,436
Dougal you have to give me
a choice between the two.

78
00:04:22,487 --> 00:04:25,001
Sorry about that.
I got a bit excited.

79
00:04:25,047 --> 00:04:27,436
Here we go again. Heads or tails?

80
00:04:27,487 --> 00:04:29,205
- Heads.
- Are you sure?

81
00:04:29,247 --> 00:04:32,319
Absolutely pos... Tails!
Heads. Tails. Heads!

82
00:04:32,367 --> 00:04:36,121
- Dougal. Calm down.
- Heads. Tails. Heads.

83
00:04:36,167 --> 00:04:37,839
Dougal, are you all right?

84
00:04:37,887 --> 00:04:41,277
I'm fine. I'm just not
the best at making decisions.

85
00:04:41,327 --> 00:04:43,522
- Look...
- Or am I?

86
00:04:43,567 --> 00:04:47,719
Tell you what we'll do.
You toss the coin, I'll take heads.

87
00:04:47,767 --> 00:04:49,962
Heads it is. Go ahead, toss it there.

88
00:04:53,007 --> 00:04:56,158
Forget it. Forget it!

89
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:01,686
Yes!

90
00:05:09,647 --> 00:05:11,717
Ted, Henry's on.

91
00:05:11,767 --> 00:05:13,485
Ted.

92
00:05:13,527 --> 00:05:17,361
'Back to you, Monica
for a five-point question.

93
00:05:17,407 --> 00:05:21,958
'The capital of England -
is it New York,

94
00:05:22,007 --> 00:05:23,838
'London...

95
00:05:23,887 --> 00:05:25,559
'or Munich?'

96
00:05:28,407 --> 00:05:31,604
'I'll give you a clue.
You live there.'

97
00:05:34,687 --> 00:05:35,881
(Bell)

98
00:05:35,927 --> 00:05:37,485
'Jane, do you know?'

99
00:05:38,807 --> 00:05:42,243
'I leaned on the button by mistake.'

100
00:05:44,047 --> 00:05:46,083
He's great, isn't he, Ted?

101
00:05:46,127 --> 00:05:50,757
Henry. And he'll be here any second.
Are you excited, Ted?

102
00:05:50,807 --> 00:05:54,436
Henry Sellers. Look at him there,
asking the questions.

103
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:58,366
'..stitch in time saves how many?'

104
00:05:58,407 --> 00:05:59,601
(Bell)

105
00:05:59,647 --> 00:06:01,956
'Oh, sorry.'

106
00:06:04,007 --> 00:06:05,599
'London.'

107
00:06:08,567 --> 00:06:10,683
Any idea why he left the BBC, Ted?

108
00:06:12,767 --> 00:06:15,361
Ah, look, Ted.
Why don't you be Elvis?

109
00:06:15,407 --> 00:06:19,286
Since you thought of it first,
I suppose it's only fair.

110
00:06:19,327 --> 00:06:20,885
I'll go as Mother Teresa.

111
00:06:22,087 --> 00:06:24,601
Oh, I'm sorry, Dougal.

112
00:06:24,647 --> 00:06:28,117
I'm being very selfish.
I'm sorry, you go as Elvis.

113
00:06:28,167 --> 00:06:31,398
No, it's not fair on you.
You had your heart set on it.

114
00:06:31,447 --> 00:06:34,723
- Seriously, you go as Elvis.
- Really? Great! Thanks.

115
00:06:36,407 --> 00:06:39,046
Unless you'd prefer to go
as Mother Teresa.

116
00:06:39,087 --> 00:06:44,002
Ah, no. Anyway, there's only one
Mother Teresa, and that's you, Ted.

117
00:06:48,287 --> 00:06:52,280
Thanks. At least I'll have the honour
of taking care of Mr Sellers.

118
00:06:52,327 --> 00:06:56,479
It's important that we be nice
to him. That'll improve our chances.

119
00:06:56,527 --> 00:06:59,917
We'll fill him with food
till it's coming out his ears.

120
00:06:59,967 --> 00:07:02,527
You'll be nice to him,
won't you, Father?

121
00:07:02,567 --> 00:07:04,717
(Groans )

122
00:07:04,767 --> 00:07:06,758
Father, are you all right?

123
00:07:09,927 --> 00:07:11,565
Oh, no.

124
00:07:11,607 --> 00:07:14,201
Not Toilet Duck again.

125
00:07:17,527 --> 00:07:21,042
You know what that does to you.

126
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:24,284
You'll be seeing
the pink elephants again.

127
00:07:24,327 --> 00:07:26,841
How many fingers am I holding up?

128
00:07:29,687 --> 00:07:30,881
Three.

129
00:07:30,927 --> 00:07:34,397
Hmm. Not too bad. Probably getting
immune to it by now.

130
00:07:34,447 --> 00:07:36,642
- (Doorbell)
- That'll be Henry. God.

131
00:07:36,687 --> 00:07:39,155
He's here.

132
00:07:39,207 --> 00:07:43,325
Hello, there. Henry Sellers.

133
00:07:43,367 --> 00:07:46,086
Father Ted Crilly.
It's an honour, Mr...

134
00:07:46,127 --> 00:07:49,119
And it's lovely to be here, too.

135
00:07:49,167 --> 00:07:51,601
Hello. Father...

136
00:07:51,647 --> 00:07:54,002
Sorry, this is Father Dougal McGuire.

137
00:07:55,167 --> 00:07:57,556
Dougal, say something to Mr Sellers.

138
00:07:57,607 --> 00:07:59,245
How old are you?

139
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:03,366
Dougal! Don't ask
Mr Sellers how old he is.

140
00:08:03,407 --> 00:08:06,205
That's quite all right.
I'm 37, Father.

141
00:08:06,247 --> 00:08:09,523
This is Father Jack Hackett.

142
00:08:09,567 --> 00:08:11,558
Hello, Father.

143
00:08:11,607 --> 00:08:13,677
Hello, Father.

144
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,803
(Screams )

145
00:08:19,687 --> 00:08:21,040
Bye, Father.

146
00:08:21,087 --> 00:08:23,396
- He's just gone for his walk.
- Oh.

147
00:08:23,447 --> 00:08:25,915
Is there anything we can get you?

148
00:08:25,967 --> 00:08:29,198
- Call me Henry.
- (Jack screaming)

149
00:08:29,247 --> 00:08:33,001
If you had something to eat,
maybe a sandwich.

150
00:08:33,047 --> 00:08:35,561
Mrs Doyle, some sandwiches.

151
00:08:35,607 --> 00:08:37,165
Right, Father.

152
00:08:37,207 --> 00:08:39,163
Ahem.

153
00:08:39,207 --> 00:08:40,196
(Laughs )

154
00:08:40,247 --> 00:08:43,364
- Is something wrong with your head?
- Dougal!

155
00:08:43,407 --> 00:08:45,796
What? It's just
his hair looks a bit...

156
00:08:45,847 --> 00:08:48,077
- Dougal.
- I didn't say anything.

157
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:50,516
It's just Henry's hair
looks a bit mad.

158
00:08:50,567 --> 00:08:53,843
Is... Is Father Dunne with you?

159
00:08:53,887 --> 00:08:56,606
Yes. He's just bringing in...
There he is.

160
00:08:56,647 --> 00:08:58,603
Ha, ha, ha! Ted!

161
00:08:58,647 --> 00:09:01,559
Barty. Good to see you.

162
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:02,835
Sit down there.

163
00:09:02,887 --> 00:09:05,037
(Laughing)

164
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:07,476
It's good to be
on Craggy Island again.

165
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:12,162
God, I haven't seen you in ages.

166
00:09:13,247 --> 00:09:15,636
I remember the last time I was here.

167
00:09:18,647 --> 00:09:21,161
We had that funny incident. Remember?

168
00:09:24,567 --> 00:09:28,242
I suppose... I suppose you've
forgotten all about it.

169
00:09:32,407 --> 00:09:34,762
It was the type of thing, you know...

170
00:09:35,847 --> 00:09:37,519
What is this?

171
00:09:37,567 --> 00:09:41,685
The last time Father Dunne was here
Father Jack lost his slippers.

172
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:47,958
It was a bit like...

173
00:09:49,487 --> 00:09:53,241
He had us looking
everywhere for them.

174
00:09:56,327 --> 00:09:59,205
It was a bit like
the type of thing, you know...

175
00:10:00,927 --> 00:10:04,044
- We found them after a while.
- It was a bit like...

176
00:10:05,527 --> 00:10:07,324
Oh, Lord.

177
00:10:07,367 --> 00:10:10,518
- How long was the car journey?
- Four hours.

178
00:10:13,007 --> 00:10:16,761
With the thing there...
I suppose it must be!

179
00:10:16,807 --> 00:10:18,877
What's it like being a TV star?

180
00:10:18,927 --> 00:10:21,964
- Well...
- It must be...

181
00:10:24,367 --> 00:10:26,517
It must be... It must be...

182
00:10:29,807 --> 00:10:33,516
We are delighted to have you.
Is there anything we can get you?

183
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:35,364
No, no. I'm fine.

184
00:10:35,407 --> 00:10:36,965
Some more sandwiches?

185
00:10:37,007 --> 00:10:38,406
No, I... Ooh!

186
00:10:38,447 --> 00:10:42,326
You've brought more in.
No, no. I'm fine.

187
00:10:42,367 --> 00:10:44,119
Absolutely fine. Thank you.

188
00:10:44,167 --> 00:10:46,123
Everything Ok with your hair?

189
00:10:46,167 --> 00:10:48,840
Dougal! Stop talking about
Henry's hair.

190
00:10:48,887 --> 00:10:51,799
I'm sorry, Henry.
Your hair is so natural looking,

191
00:10:51,847 --> 00:10:54,202
Dougal can't stop talking about it.

192
00:10:54,247 --> 00:10:57,364
It really is
a beautiful head of hair.

193
00:10:58,367 --> 00:11:02,155
Anyway, what I was saying was,
anything you want, just ask us.

194
00:11:02,207 --> 00:11:05,279
We can get it for you.
There's no problem there.

195
00:11:05,327 --> 00:11:09,639
Anything you want that would be
at all possible for us to get you,

196
00:11:09,687 --> 00:11:11,962
just ask for it.

197
00:11:12,007 --> 00:11:14,316
And I mean anything.

198
00:11:14,367 --> 00:11:16,835
There's no problem there.
Anything.

199
00:11:16,887 --> 00:11:19,799
I have had trouble
getting the English papers.

200
00:11:19,847 --> 00:11:23,476
- Would it be possible...
- Except the English papers.

201
00:11:23,527 --> 00:11:26,837
Anything else, just ask.
Except the English papers.

202
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:30,163
You wouldn't have the number
of a Father Dick Byrne?

203
00:11:30,207 --> 00:11:32,562
It would be a mistake to visit them.

204
00:11:32,607 --> 00:11:34,677
Why is that, Father?

205
00:11:36,927 --> 00:11:38,997
They're lepers.

206
00:11:39,927 --> 00:11:40,916
What?

207
00:11:40,967 --> 00:11:44,880
The three of them are lepers.
Rugged Island is a leper colony.

208
00:11:46,207 --> 00:11:48,516
Leper colony? You're not serious?

209
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:52,721
No, not leprosy.
But there's something wrong.

210
00:11:52,767 --> 00:11:54,803
Did you never think
how strange it was,

211
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:57,407
three priests living alone
on an island?

212
00:11:57,447 --> 00:11:59,165
I suppose...

213
00:11:59,207 --> 00:12:02,643
Something's not right there.
You're better off with us.

214
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:05,599
Ted, could you tell me
where the old...

215
00:12:05,647 --> 00:12:08,002
You know, the old...

216
00:12:08,047 --> 00:12:11,357
The old...is up the stairs
and first on the left.

217
00:12:11,407 --> 00:12:12,601
Thank you.

218
00:12:14,007 --> 00:12:15,645
It's a wig.

219
00:12:16,807 --> 00:12:18,718
(Bell)

220
00:12:18,767 --> 00:12:21,964
Time for a little nightcap.

221
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:26,603
You're running out of sandwiches.
I'll bring you in some more.

222
00:12:26,647 --> 00:12:28,877
I won't have a sherry, thank you.

223
00:12:28,927 --> 00:12:31,157
Don't be silly. Of course you will.

224
00:12:31,207 --> 00:12:34,404
- No. I shouldn't.
- Go on, it'll help you sleep.

225
00:12:34,447 --> 00:12:36,324
No. You go ahead.

226
00:12:36,367 --> 00:12:39,757
Just a little drop.
Just a teeny tiny bit.

227
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:42,037
The day a little sherry hurts anyone

228
00:12:42,087 --> 00:12:45,796
is the day Ireland doesn't win
the Eurovision Song Contest.

229
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:48,718
- Go on.
- No, I shouldn't.

230
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:52,362
Go on. Go on, go on.

231
00:12:53,407 --> 00:12:55,796
Go on. Go on.

232
00:12:55,847 --> 00:13:00,875
Go on, go on, go on, go on,
go on, go on, go on.

233
00:13:00,927 --> 00:13:02,326
No. Seriously, I...

234
00:13:02,367 --> 00:13:06,440
Go on, go on, go on, go on,
go on, go on, go on,

235
00:13:06,487 --> 00:13:08,557
go on, go on, go on, go on, go on,

236
00:13:08,607 --> 00:13:10,404
GO ON!

237
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:20,841
Oh, what a shower of bastards!

238
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:26,481
Lord, Ted, why did you
give him a drink?

239
00:13:26,527 --> 00:13:28,563
I didn't know this would happen.

240
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:31,565
That's why they sacked him
from that programme.

241
00:13:31,607 --> 00:13:35,282
He's a terrible alcoholic.
He's been on the wagon for a year.

242
00:13:35,327 --> 00:13:37,966
- Oh, God, Ted.
- How was I supposed to know?

243
00:13:38,007 --> 00:13:41,886
Sack me? Sack me!

244
00:13:41,927 --> 00:13:44,885
I made the BBC!

245
00:13:44,927 --> 00:13:46,724
(Sobs )

246
00:13:48,087 --> 00:13:49,964
I made it.

247
00:13:50,487 --> 00:13:53,285
Maybe if you have a rest
you'll feel better.

248
00:13:53,327 --> 00:13:56,558
Get away from me! Priest!

249
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:58,438
I think it's time we got to bed.

250
00:13:59,687 --> 00:14:02,076
Good man. There's never anything on.

251
00:14:02,127 --> 00:14:05,005
- I'll give it a kick myself.
- You want a fight?

252
00:14:05,047 --> 00:14:07,322
I'd love a bit of a scrap but...

253
00:14:07,367 --> 00:14:09,801
- Bloody priests!
- (Laughs )

254
00:14:09,847 --> 00:14:12,680
Bloody sanctimonious scumbags!

255
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:16,276
- Absolutely.
- Made my life a bloody misery.

256
00:14:16,327 --> 00:14:20,366
Sorry about that. Are you sure
you wouldn't like to go to bed?

257
00:14:20,407 --> 00:14:22,523
Maybe we could stay up a bit longer.

258
00:14:22,567 --> 00:14:25,445
I'm fed up with you bastards!

259
00:14:25,487 --> 00:14:29,765
I'm getting out of here.
Don't you try and stop me.

260
00:14:29,807 --> 00:14:31,320
Aaaaaaah!

261
00:14:33,607 --> 00:14:35,598
It's true what they say though,

262
00:14:35,647 --> 00:14:39,560
you should never meet your heroes,
you'll only be disappointed.

263
00:14:43,607 --> 00:14:46,804
Imagine we couldn't get him back.
He'd be like Big Foot,

264
00:14:46,847 --> 00:14:49,566
except he'd be
a BBC television presenter.

265
00:14:49,607 --> 00:14:51,245
Do you see him?

266
00:14:51,287 --> 00:14:53,721
There, by the trees.

267
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:56,924
Got him.

268
00:14:58,287 --> 00:15:00,084
There he is.

269
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:04,445
- Terribly sorry about this.
- No problem.

270
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:08,605
I've been through it before.
Actors, television personalities -

271
00:15:08,647 --> 00:15:12,435
they go off drink and drugs
and come over to places like this.

272
00:15:12,487 --> 00:15:16,082
The solitude can get to them.
What happened to this fella?

273
00:15:16,127 --> 00:15:19,278
He was fine one minute,
then he took a sip of sherry.

274
00:15:19,327 --> 00:15:22,683
Relapse, that's when
they're most dangerous. Ready?

275
00:15:22,727 --> 00:15:25,639
I want you to bang
these together and shout.

276
00:15:25,687 --> 00:15:29,362
That'll scare him out of the woods
so I can get a clear shot.

277
00:15:29,407 --> 00:15:32,205
- You're shooting him?
- Tranquilliser dart.

278
00:15:32,247 --> 00:15:35,239
- It'll put him to sleep.
- It seems a bit extreme.

279
00:15:35,287 --> 00:15:38,324
It's the best way, Father.
Believe me.

280
00:15:38,367 --> 00:15:40,358
You know best.

281
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:44,279
God, this reminds me of Vietnam.

282
00:15:44,327 --> 00:15:47,842
- Were you in Vietnam?
- No, no. You know, the films.

283
00:15:47,887 --> 00:15:49,479
All right. Let's go.

284
00:15:51,567 --> 00:15:53,398
Come on Henry.

285
00:15:53,447 --> 00:15:55,085
Out you come. There.

286
00:15:56,207 --> 00:15:57,435
Got him.

287
00:15:58,047 --> 00:15:59,366
(Gunshot)

288
00:16:00,647 --> 00:16:01,796
It's Jack.

289
00:16:03,647 --> 00:16:07,925
I've got a clear shot of him, Father.
Do you want me to get him?

290
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,764
No. Let him go.

291
00:16:09,807 --> 00:16:12,799
- He'll make his own way back.
- Look at him go.

292
00:16:17,487 --> 00:16:19,523
Beautiful.

293
00:16:19,567 --> 00:16:22,320
Oh, my God. My head.

294
00:16:22,367 --> 00:16:25,325
There you are, Henry,
a nice cup of tea.

295
00:16:25,367 --> 00:16:27,483
What? Oh, my God.

296
00:16:27,527 --> 00:16:30,087
Where am I? What happened last night?

297
00:16:30,127 --> 00:16:32,687
I remember having a sip
of sherry, but...

298
00:16:32,727 --> 00:16:34,206
Nothing to worry about.

299
00:16:34,247 --> 00:16:36,636
I hope I didn't do anything
to embarrass you.

300
00:16:36,687 --> 00:16:38,166
(Giggles )

301
00:16:38,887 --> 00:16:41,959
Dougal! No, you were fine, Henry.

302
00:16:42,007 --> 00:16:43,281
(Phone )

303
00:16:43,327 --> 00:16:46,205
That'll be Father Byrne.
I feel sorry for him,

304
00:16:46,247 --> 00:16:50,559
marooned with those idiots,
and they've nothing in common.

305
00:16:50,607 --> 00:16:52,598
..nothing in common. Hello.

306
00:16:52,647 --> 00:16:55,684
- Hello, Dick.
- Ted, we were talking about you.

307
00:16:55,727 --> 00:16:58,036
- Really?
- Saying you great you were.

308
00:16:58,087 --> 00:17:00,920
- Really?
- No!

309
00:17:00,967 --> 00:17:02,605
Hilarious, Dick.

310
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:05,798
- Are you going to turn up tonight?
- Why wouldn't I?

311
00:17:05,847 --> 00:17:09,806
Well, it might be a little
embarrassing to come last again.

312
00:17:09,847 --> 00:17:13,476
We won't come last,
it's you who'll be coming last.

313
00:17:13,527 --> 00:17:16,963
In fact, I thought we might have
a little bet on tonight.

314
00:17:17,007 --> 00:17:19,282
Put your money
where your mouth is.

315
00:17:19,327 --> 00:17:21,557
What are we talking?
A pound? Two?

316
00:17:23,687 --> 00:17:25,086
Five pounds.

317
00:17:26,487 --> 00:17:27,681
Five pounds?

318
00:17:27,727 --> 00:17:30,161
What's the matter, Dick? You scared?

319
00:17:30,207 --> 00:17:33,597
Of course not. Five pounds it is.
See you tonight.

320
00:17:34,687 --> 00:17:38,521
Well, I'd better go and get meself
cleaned up for tonight.

321
00:17:38,567 --> 00:17:43,118
Brush me teeth... I've a very strange
taste of raw meat in my mouth.

322
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:46,523
- I don't know why.
- Right you are, Henry.

323
00:17:47,807 --> 00:17:51,925
Five pounds, I must be insane.
We haven't a hope in hell.

324
00:17:51,967 --> 00:17:54,083
Why can't we all go as Elvis?

325
00:17:54,127 --> 00:17:56,118
Because we all look the same.

326
00:17:56,167 --> 00:17:58,965
Anyway, Jack'll be in any moment
for his drink.

327
00:17:59,007 --> 00:18:00,360
(Glass smashes )

328
00:18:00,407 --> 00:18:02,238
(Jack) Drink!

329
00:18:02,287 --> 00:18:04,437
There he goes, bang on time.

330
00:18:06,767 --> 00:18:09,156
God, Ted. He looks very rough.

331
00:18:09,207 --> 00:18:11,960
We'll have to get him sober
before the contest.

332
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:14,396
No, Dougal. Wait. Leave him.

333
00:18:16,287 --> 00:18:18,517
I have an idea.

334
00:18:20,447 --> 00:18:22,119

(Whistling)

340
00:18:44,327 --> 00:18:49,526
Fantastic, Father Harry Coyle there.
You know, he looks a bit like...

341
00:18:50,967 --> 00:18:53,845
He won't mind me telling you
this now...

342
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:59,326
Ah, no. Anyway, Henry,
marks for Father Coyle.

343
00:18:59,367 --> 00:19:03,201
Very good. I'll give him
seven out of ten.

344
00:19:03,247 --> 00:19:04,805
Bastard.

345
00:19:04,847 --> 00:19:06,883
Not bad at all!

346
00:19:06,927 --> 00:19:10,636
Ziggy played guitar.

347
00:19:10,687 --> 00:19:14,202
That means the lads from
Rugged Island are still in the lead

348
00:19:14,247 --> 00:19:16,044
with nine out of ten.

349
00:19:16,087 --> 00:19:19,875
So a big hand for Diana Ross
and two of the Supremes.

351
00:19:23,847 --> 00:19:25,678
Don't start celebrating yet.

352
00:19:25,727 --> 00:19:28,082
Remember we've got
one more act to go.

353
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:30,766
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome...

354
00:19:30,807 --> 00:19:34,038

00:20:24,527 --> 00:20:26,483
Thank you very much.

came back with the comeback special.'

he played in Las Vegas

Fantastic! Lord God Almighty!

Three Elvises!

388
00:21:35,047 --> 00:21:38,164
(Laughs ) Well, Henry, over to you

389
00:21:38,207 --> 00:21:39,720
for the final marks.

Brilliant, Ted. It was fantastic.

(Laughs )

394
00:22:00,487 --> 00:22:02,239
Thanks very much, Barty.

395
00:22:04,287 --> 00:22:07,120
- Five pounds, Ted.
- Hard luck, Dick.

396
00:22:07,167 --> 00:22:10,000
- Did we not win?
- No, you didn't win, Cyril.

397
00:22:10,047 --> 00:22:13,596
This year the trophy
goes to Craggy Island.

398
00:22:13,647 --> 00:22:16,286
You've every chance
of winning next year.

399
00:22:16,327 --> 00:22:18,841
- Really?
- No!

400
00:22:18,887 --> 00:22:21,117
Come on, Cyril. Let's go home.

401
00:22:22,167 --> 00:22:24,123
I'm out of fecking whiskey!

402
00:22:24,167 --> 00:22:26,886
There's plenty of whiskey
at home, Father.

403
00:22:28,127 --> 00:22:30,482
That Cyril MacDuff's
an awful idiot.

404
00:22:30,527 --> 00:22:32,040
Here we are now.

405
00:22:32,087 --> 00:22:34,920
Since I didn't make a fool
of meself last time,

406
00:22:34,967 --> 00:22:38,039
I might as well have
a glass of Champagne, cheers.

407
00:22:38,087 --> 00:22:40,043
Henry, no!

408
00:22:40,087 --> 00:22:45,366
Don't worry, Father. If I can't
celebrate tonight, sure when can I?

409
00:22:45,407 --> 00:22:50,356
The bastards! What the hell is going
on? How dare they do this to me?

410
00:22:50,407 --> 00:22:53,877
How dare they sack me?
I'm Henry Sellers!

411
00:22:53,927 --> 00:22:57,886
I'm Henry Selleeeeeers!

412
00:22:57,927 --> 00:23:01,124
- Well, there he goes again.
- You're right there.

413
00:23:01,167 --> 00:23:05,160
Never mind. We'll look for him
in the morning. Anyway, well done.

414
00:23:05,207 --> 00:23:09,200
- What do you think of the trophy?
- It's great. All because of you.

415
00:23:09,247 --> 00:23:11,044
Put it there, Dougal.

I must have read that ten times.

4
00:00:34,607 --> 00:00:36,962
I love a bit of Oscar Wilde,
I suppose.

5
00:00:37,007 --> 00:00:39,282
- He does it for me.
- Oh, Wilde.

6
00:00:39,327 --> 00:00:41,716
"The only thing worse than being
talked about

7
00:00:41,767 --> 00:00:45,157
- "is not being talked about."
Exactly.

8
00:00:45,207 --> 00:00:47,926
Wilde couldn't have
put it better himself.

9
00:00:47,967 --> 00:00:51,676
It was him who said that,
actually, Father.

10
00:00:52,527 --> 00:00:57,396
Yes, yes, but I don' think he'd have
said it in that kind of ladylike way.

11
00:00:57,447 --> 00:00:59,438
You're a charmer, Father.

12
00:00:59,487 --> 00:01:02,797
Miss Clarke, I don't suppose
you'd sign a copy of the latest?

13
00:01:02,847 --> 00:01:04,917
I'd be delighted.

14
00:01:04,967 --> 00:01:07,879
Father Ted Cri...
No, just Ted Crilly.

15
00:01:07,927 --> 00:01:09,645
Don't bother about the Father.

16
00:01:09,687 --> 00:01:12,360
I envy you really, Father.

17
00:01:12,407 --> 00:01:16,116
You must have great peace of mind,
being a priest.

18
00:01:16,167 --> 00:01:19,204
That's what I'd love.
A feeling of serenity.

19
00:01:19,247 --> 00:01:21,841
Oh, I have serenity
coming out of my ears.

20
00:01:21,887 --> 00:01:25,766
Too much serenity, really.
Bit of excitement would suit me.

21
00:01:25,807 --> 00:01:28,275
Thanks for the autograph.
I have to go.

22
00:01:28,327 --> 00:01:30,795
Some nuns are visiting us
so we're busy.

23
00:01:30,847 --> 00:01:32,439
- Ok, Father.
- Thank you.

24
00:01:32,487 --> 00:01:34,398
- Good luck with the book.
- Bye.

25
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,200
Feck.

26
00:01:42,247 --> 00:01:44,715
- Hello, there.
- Father Curley.

27
00:01:44,767 --> 00:01:47,201
- Going up?
- Thanks.

28

00:02:06,647 --> 00:02:08,797
Well...

30
00:02:08,847 --> 00:02:11,441
- Good luck again.
- Thank you, Father.

31
00:02:11,487 --> 00:02:13,557
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

32
00:02:16,247 --> 00:02:17,919
Well, hello again.

33
00:02:17,967 --> 00:02:19,286
Ah, hello.

34
00:02:19,327 --> 00:02:21,363
We have to stop meeting like this.

35
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:22,556
(High-pitched laugh)

36
00:02:22,607 --> 00:02:24,563
Goodbye again.

37
00:02:24,607 --> 00:02:26,643
Good luck with the book.

38
00:02:38,967 --> 00:02:40,559

39
00:02:43,167 --> 00:02:44,805
(Ted) Change.

40
00:02:44,847 --> 00:02:47,520
Please change, for God's sake.

41
00:02:51,567 --> 00:02:54,365
Good luck with the book.

42
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:55,476
(Mouths )

43
00:02:59,327 --> 00:03:01,602
Please change. Please!

44
00:03:01,647 --> 00:03:03,046
Please change.

45
00:03:03,087 --> 00:03:05,317
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord's...

46
00:03:05,367 --> 00:03:08,086
- Bye.
- Here we go.

47
00:03:08,127 --> 00:03:10,436
Oh, God Almighty.

48
00:03:11,487 --> 00:03:13,557
Oh, Christ.

49
00:03:14,687 --> 00:03:16,484
Sorry about that.

50
00:03:34,687 --> 00:03:37,201
All right, what's going on?

51
00:03:40,367 --> 00:03:44,042
- Miss Clarke.
- What are you doing here?

52
00:03:44,087 --> 00:03:46,043
I'm the parish priest here.

53
00:03:46,087 --> 00:03:50,126
That's extraordinary! I think
someone's trying to keep us together.

54
00:03:50,167 --> 00:03:51,486
(Laughs )

55
00:03:51,527 --> 00:03:55,122
I've rented a cottage on the island,
but it's not ready yet.

56
00:03:55,167 --> 00:03:59,160
The builders suggested I stay here
for the night. Is that Ok?

57
00:03:59,207 --> 00:04:01,243
This is amazing!

58
00:04:01,287 --> 00:04:03,801
We were both going the same way!

59
00:04:05,487 --> 00:04:08,638
Of course, you'd be very welcome
to stay the night.

60
00:04:08,687 --> 00:04:11,485
Hello, Father.
I see you've met your guest.

61
00:04:11,527 --> 00:04:13,643
Miss Clarke is staying the night.

62
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:15,962
- Will you show her the spare room?
- What?

63
00:04:16,007 --> 00:04:18,043
Will you show her the spare room?

64
00:04:18,087 --> 00:04:21,682
Well, yes. It's just that
I was going to make some tea.

65
00:04:21,727 --> 00:04:23,479
You can do that later.

66
00:04:23,527 --> 00:04:26,803
I think tea is a bit common
for Miss Clarke's tastes.

67
00:04:26,847 --> 00:04:28,678
All right, come on.

68
00:04:30,527 --> 00:04:31,562
Have a shower.

69
00:04:31,607 --> 00:04:34,201
I mean have a shower if you want.

70
00:04:35,207 --> 00:04:38,358
I don't want you
to have a shower, I mean...

71
00:04:38,407 --> 00:04:42,525
you might like to get out of your
clothes, not that it's my concern.

72
00:04:43,527 --> 00:04:44,721
Mrs Doyle.

73
00:05:01,687 --> 00:05:03,598
Ted.

74
00:05:03,647 --> 00:05:05,478
Who was that?

75
00:05:05,527 --> 00:05:08,360
Dougal, what do you think
you're doing?

76
00:05:08,407 --> 00:05:10,125
I was hiding.

77
00:05:10,167 --> 00:05:12,635
- Hiding from who?
- From your woman.

78
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:15,565
I heard her coming
so I hid behind the chair.

79
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:17,404
Dougal, she's only a woman.

80
00:05:17,447 --> 00:05:19,881
I don't know very many women, Ted.

81
00:05:19,927 --> 00:05:22,487
Dougal, what about your mother?

82
00:05:22,527 --> 00:05:25,599
My mother?! She's hardly
what you'd call a woman.

83
00:05:25,647 --> 00:05:28,036
She's not like the women
on the telly.

84
00:05:28,087 --> 00:05:31,284
Like the Gladiators.
She wouldn't be one of them.

85
00:05:31,327 --> 00:05:34,125
I'm...sure that's their loss.

86
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,362
What about Mrs Doyle? She's a woman.

87
00:05:36,407 --> 00:05:37,476
Ah, now. Come on.

88
00:05:37,527 --> 00:05:39,882
She is. She's every bit
as much a woman

89
00:05:39,927 --> 00:05:43,363
as one of the Gladiators
or the lady who runs Pakistan.

90
00:05:43,407 --> 00:05:47,400
What you mean is, she's not
attractive in the conventional sense.

91
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:49,563
You can't think like that any more.

92
00:05:49,607 --> 00:05:51,723
Anyway, who's that one?

93
00:05:51,767 --> 00:05:54,600
She's a novelist.
I was at her book-signing.

94
00:05:54,647 --> 00:05:58,526
She's taken a cottage on the island.
Very sophisticated lady.

95
00:05:58,567 --> 00:05:59,761
(Screaming)

96
00:06:05,527 --> 00:06:08,087
I'm sorry.
I just got a bit of a shock.

97
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:10,516
Come on now, Father.

98
00:06:10,567 --> 00:06:12,239
This is Father Hackett.

99
00:06:13,647 --> 00:06:17,720
He gets a bit confused sometimes.
Come on, Father.

100
00:06:17,767 --> 00:06:21,237
No, not your room.
Not your room. No...

101
00:06:23,127 --> 00:06:25,595
Arse! Feck! Arse!

102
00:06:25,647 --> 00:06:28,525
- Give me the cards quickly.
- Arse! Feck!

103
00:06:28,567 --> 00:06:30,762
- What colour?
- Blue, quickly!

104
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,445
Arse! F...

105
00:06:34,207 --> 00:06:36,767
Blue has a great
calming effect on him.

106
00:06:36,807 --> 00:06:39,082
That's Miss Clarke. Dougal!

107
00:06:39,127 --> 00:06:41,641
- Woman!
- Yes, it is a woman, Father.

108
00:06:41,687 --> 00:06:43,359
Right on the button.

109
00:06:43,407 --> 00:06:46,126
Well, have a lovely stay, then.

110
00:07:18,327 --> 00:07:19,646
(Door opens )

111
00:07:21,127 --> 00:07:22,765
Hello, Dougal.

112
00:07:22,807 --> 00:07:27,119
Good idea, Ted. You're throwing out
the ones you couldn't get through.

113
00:07:28,487 --> 00:07:32,036
No. No, I was just arranging them
in alphabetical order.

114
00:07:32,087 --> 00:07:35,204
- Fair enough.
- You're bringing Father Jack out?

115
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:37,886
Yes. I suppose so.
D'you want to come?

116
00:07:37,927 --> 00:07:40,600
No, no. I'd better stay here and...

117
00:07:40,647 --> 00:07:43,115
prepare for the nuns.

118
00:07:43,167 --> 00:07:45,965
Father, it's a beautiful day out.

119
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,076
Me arse.

120
00:07:47,127 --> 00:07:50,915
Would you like him on manual
or automatic, Father?

121
00:07:50,967 --> 00:07:52,923
Automatic. It's a nice day.

122
00:07:52,967 --> 00:07:55,765
- Might as well take it easy.
- Take your time.

123
00:07:55,807 --> 00:07:57,035
Fair enough.

124
00:07:57,087 --> 00:07:58,679
(Gasps in excitement)

125
00:08:06,967 --> 00:08:11,279
Well, Father, I never thought we'd
have anyone like her staying here.

126
00:08:11,327 --> 00:08:14,763
Hmm? Oh, Miss Clarke.
It's very exciting, isn't it?

127
00:08:14,807 --> 00:08:18,641
- Famous novelist here.
- You've never read any of her books.

128
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,678
Actually, I'm a bit of a fan.

129
00:08:20,727 --> 00:08:23,560
I was at her book-signing
the other day.

130
00:08:23,607 --> 00:08:27,759
I'm surprised, Father. I didn't think
you'd like that sort of thing.

131
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:29,638
I read a bit of one of them once.

132
00:08:29,687 --> 00:08:33,646
God I couldn't finish it.
The language. Unbelievable.

133
00:08:33,687 --> 00:08:37,805
It's a bit gritty. But that's
the modern world, Mrs Doyle.

134
00:08:37,847 --> 00:08:41,920
It's a bit much for me, Father.
"Feck this" and "feck that".

135
00:08:41,967 --> 00:08:43,878
Yes, Mrs Doyle.

136
00:08:43,927 --> 00:08:47,203
"You big bastard."
Oh, dreadful language.

137
00:08:47,247 --> 00:08:50,080
"You big hairy arse."
"You big fecker."

138
00:08:50,127 --> 00:08:52,118
Fierce stuff!

139
00:08:52,167 --> 00:08:54,556
And of course, the F-word, Father.

140
00:08:54,607 --> 00:08:59,556
The bad F-word. Worse than feck.
You know the one I mean.

141
00:08:59,607 --> 00:09:00,926
Yes, I do, Mrs Doyle.

142
00:09:00,967 --> 00:09:04,562
"F you." "F your effing wife."

143
00:09:04,607 --> 00:09:07,565
I don't know why they have to use
language like that.

144
00:09:07,607 --> 00:09:12,283
"I'll stick this effing pitchfork up
your hole." That was another one.

145
00:09:12,327 --> 00:09:14,283
I see what you mean, Mrs Doyle.

146
00:09:14,327 --> 00:09:16,318
"Bastard this" and "bastard that".

147
00:09:16,367 --> 00:09:19,837
You can't move for the bastards.
It's wall-to-wall bastards.

148
00:09:19,887 --> 00:09:22,959
- Is it Mrs Doyle?
- "You bastard." "You fecker."

149
00:09:23,007 --> 00:09:27,205
"You bollocks! Get your bollocks
out of my face."

150
00:09:27,247 --> 00:09:30,080
Yes, you just go and prepare
for the nuns.

151
00:09:30,127 --> 00:09:33,517
(Mrs Doyle ) "Ride me sideways"
was another one.

152
00:09:42,367 --> 00:09:45,120
There we go. Hah! Miss Clarke!

153
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:50,166
- How did you sleep?
- Like a log. It's so peaceful here.

154
00:09:50,207 --> 00:09:53,040
I need a bit of peace
after the year I've had.

155
00:09:53,087 --> 00:09:54,440
I see.

156
00:09:54,487 --> 00:09:58,116
(Sighs ) I've had a rough time
of it recently, Father.

157
00:09:58,167 --> 00:10:01,125
My husband left me for another woman.

158
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:03,727
Though it was my fault, I suppose.

159
00:10:03,767 --> 00:10:07,760
The sex was getting a little boring
and I did nothing to spice it up.

160
00:10:08,807 --> 00:10:11,367
Ha! Isn't that always the way?

161
00:10:12,527 --> 00:10:15,200
But nearer the end,
I tried a few things.

162
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:18,159
I used to dress up
in revealing lingerie,

163
00:10:18,207 --> 00:10:20,198
and when he came through the door

164
00:10:20,247 --> 00:10:23,478
I leapt on top of him and had sex
right there in the hall.

165
00:10:27,167 --> 00:10:29,158
So, you had a good sleep, then?

166
00:10:29,207 --> 00:10:31,357
Yes. Yes, thank you.

167
00:10:31,407 --> 00:10:34,843
Oh, God. I'm sorry, Father.
I've probably shocked you.

168
00:10:34,887 --> 00:10:36,479
Oh! Go away with you.

169
00:10:36,527 --> 00:10:40,566
I've heard more shocking things
through the years in confession.

170
00:10:47,927 --> 00:10:50,566
Do you every think about the future?

171
00:10:50,607 --> 00:10:55,237
I used to think about the future,
and then it became the present,

172
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:58,040
so I thought about it
quite often then,

173
00:10:58,087 --> 00:11:01,762
and then it was in the past
so I didn't think about it that much.

174
00:11:01,807 --> 00:11:04,685
Do you like Dostoevsky?

175
00:11:04,727 --> 00:11:07,924
Oh, him. Yes.
He's one of my favourites.

176
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:10,561
I have read that book...ten times.

177
00:11:10,607 --> 00:11:13,280
You're reading it again.
You're on page seven.

178
00:11:15,087 --> 00:11:20,241
Did you feel his sense of commitment
waned towards the end?

179
00:11:20,287 --> 00:11:22,755
Yes.

180
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:25,321
When did you feel
that began to happen?

181
00:11:25,367 --> 00:11:28,120
Towards the end, you know.

182
00:11:28,167 --> 00:11:31,398
After he'd finished
writing about the crime bit

183
00:11:31,447 --> 00:11:33,483
and moved on to the punishment.

184
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:35,643
I felt it dragged a bit there for me.

185
00:11:35,687 --> 00:11:39,157
I always thought that if Joyce,
k eats and Lawrence

186
00:11:39,207 --> 00:11:42,802
were sitting in a room together
and Dostoevsky walked in,

187
00:11:42,847 --> 00:11:46,396
there'd be a hell of a fight
for the last piece of pudding.

188
00:11:52,967 --> 00:11:56,755
It's great to talk to somebody
about these things.

189
00:11:56,807 --> 00:12:01,483
My husband, there was a man who
was really afraid of Virginia Woolf.

190
00:12:02,807 --> 00:12:05,367
Why, was...

191
00:12:05,407 --> 00:12:07,762
Was she following him,
or something?

192
00:12:13,047 --> 00:12:14,844
Oh, Father!

193
00:12:16,607 --> 00:12:20,919
You... You wouldn't like to come up
to the cottage later?

194
00:12:21,967 --> 00:12:25,084
For a little drink?
Maybe some more book talk.

195
00:12:25,127 --> 00:12:28,244
- That would be delightflug.
- Sorry?

196
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,118
I'd be delightigetted.

197
00:12:32,207 --> 00:12:35,085
I'll see you later, then.
About seven?

198
00:12:35,127 --> 00:12:37,038
Seven o'clock.

199
00:12:37,087 --> 00:12:38,805
(Sighs )

200
00:12:38,847 --> 00:12:40,644
Seven, right.

201
00:12:46,727 --> 00:12:48,558
It's only a drink.

202
00:12:58,607 --> 00:13:00,723
So, you'd no trouble getting here?

203
00:13:00,767 --> 00:13:04,840
No. I drove the Renault,
Sister Margaret took the Mini.

204
00:13:04,887 --> 00:13:08,323
It's great having the old car
all the same, isn't it?

205
00:13:08,367 --> 00:13:11,040
Anyone for more tea?

206
00:13:12,087 --> 00:13:13,486
Sister Margaret?

207
00:13:13,527 --> 00:13:16,325
- (Meekly) No thank you, Father.
- Sorry?

208
00:13:16,367 --> 00:13:18,244
She's fine, Father.

209
00:13:18,287 --> 00:13:20,847
At what time does the Mass
tonight start?

210
00:13:20,887 --> 00:13:24,118
- Seven o'clock.
- Grand. We don't want to be late.

211
00:13:24,167 --> 00:13:27,682
- Seven isn't too... Aaaah!
- Are you all right?

212
00:13:27,727 --> 00:13:29,877
Yes, yes it's... There's just...

213
00:13:29,927 --> 00:13:32,566
Seven o'clock,
I may have to leave early.

214
00:13:32,607 --> 00:13:36,236
During the Mass?
You couldn't leave during the Mass.

215
00:13:36,287 --> 00:13:37,640
It's just, you see...

216
00:13:37,687 --> 00:13:40,155
Sister Julia says
you say a lovely Mass.

217
00:13:40,207 --> 00:13:43,597
She said, you said the nicest
Mass she ever heard.

218
00:13:43,647 --> 00:13:47,720
Sister Concepta said that
last year's Mass here was fabulous.

219
00:13:47,767 --> 00:13:50,804
Ten out of ten,
and she's hard to please.

220
00:13:50,847 --> 00:13:53,725
She's seen, what...
Is it 50 Masses since then?

221
00:13:55,207 --> 00:13:59,405
Show Father Crilly the photographs.
You'll like these, Father.

222
00:14:02,367 --> 00:14:05,165
There's you, saying the Mass
here last year.

223
00:14:05,207 --> 00:14:09,166
And that's you saying
the Mass the year before.

224
00:14:09,207 --> 00:14:13,086
What's that? Oh, yes,
your sister-in-law's funeral.

225
00:14:13,127 --> 00:14:15,118
That's my personal favourite.

226
00:14:16,287 --> 00:14:18,118
That's when you had the beard.

227
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:26,682
Actually, Father, you couldn't sign
a few of them for us, could you?

228
00:14:26,727 --> 00:14:28,763
- The photographs?
- Yes.

229
00:14:28,807 --> 00:14:30,001
All right.

230
00:14:30,047 --> 00:14:33,039
Could you put on my one,
"to Sister Assumpta"?

231
00:14:33,087 --> 00:14:34,839
Sure.

232
00:14:34,887 --> 00:14:36,366
Oh!

233
00:14:36,407 --> 00:14:39,160
Father, Sister Margaret
has a question.

234
00:14:39,207 --> 00:14:40,322
Yes?

235
00:14:40,367 --> 00:14:43,086
Where d'you get ideas
for your sermons?

236
00:14:43,127 --> 00:14:45,595
Where do you get your ideas
for your sermons?

237
00:14:45,647 --> 00:14:48,115
Oh, just...

238
00:14:48,167 --> 00:14:51,239
overheard conversations,
the news, whatever.

239
00:14:51,287 --> 00:14:52,925
To be honest, I might not..

240
00:14:52,967 --> 00:14:56,357
(Shrieks ) Sister Julia,
do you have a question?

241
00:14:56,407 --> 00:14:59,877
What's your most embarrassing
moment saying Mass?

242
00:14:59,927 --> 00:15:04,557
Oh, I suppose it was the time
I forgot my sister-in-law's name.

243
00:15:06,487 --> 00:15:08,478
That got me hot under the collar.

244
00:15:08,527 --> 00:15:10,404
(All giggling)

245
00:15:14,167 --> 00:15:15,839
Anyway...

246
00:15:15,887 --> 00:15:20,517
Anyway, the thing is, I might not
be able to say this evening's Mass.

247
00:15:20,567 --> 00:15:22,364
(Silence )

248
00:15:23,247 --> 00:15:27,445
- What, Father?
- I have something important to do.

249
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:30,684
Not more important
than saying Mass, Father?

250
00:15:30,727 --> 00:15:33,924
It's just, someone I know is dying.

251
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:36,845
Oh, dear. Is it serious?

252
00:15:39,367 --> 00:15:43,076
Yes. In this case, the person dying
is quite seriously ill.

253
00:15:43,127 --> 00:15:45,038
It's someone we know very well.

254
00:15:46,407 --> 00:15:49,399
Nuns! Nuns! Reverse! Reverse!

255
00:15:49,447 --> 00:15:51,756
Reverse! Reverse!

256
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:54,480
Hello Father McGuire.

257
00:15:54,527 --> 00:15:58,236
Father Crilly was just telling us
about your friend, dying.

258
00:15:58,287 --> 00:15:59,800
Who was that, Ted?

259
00:16:01,367 --> 00:16:04,882
Um... Er... Old Jim.

260
00:16:04,927 --> 00:16:07,680
Ah, is he dying? Poor old Jim.

261
00:16:07,727 --> 00:16:10,036
He won't like that.

262
00:16:11,047 --> 00:16:13,038
He's terribly down about it.

263
00:16:14,087 --> 00:16:16,726
- Wait a second. Jim Halpin?
- Yes.

264
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:20,203
I was talking to him earlier
and he didn't say a thing.

265
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:25,806
Well, that's Jim.
Brave is not the word.

266
00:16:25,847 --> 00:16:28,645
He's just outside.
Hold on and I'll get him.

267
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:31,645
What's he doing outside?
He should be in bed.

268
00:16:31,687 --> 00:16:34,963
I met him earlier.
He wanted the lend of some sugar.

269
00:16:35,007 --> 00:16:38,795
Dougal, at a moment like this,
this man needs peace. Don't...

270
00:16:38,847 --> 00:16:41,725
- Hello, Jim.
- Hello, Father.

271
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:43,678
Hello, Sisters.

272
00:16:43,727 --> 00:16:46,844
Now Jim, you never told me
you were ill.

273
00:16:46,887 --> 00:16:50,846
What? Oh, I had a bit of a cold
a few weeks back.

274
00:16:50,887 --> 00:16:53,720
A cold? Ted said you were dying.

275
00:16:53,767 --> 00:16:56,759
Dying? Oh, no.

276
00:16:57,407 --> 00:16:59,398
I don't think so, anyway.

277
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:04,559
It's just I was talking
to Dr Sinnott.

278
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:06,598
He said...

279
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:12,006
He said you might be dying
but he wasn't 100% sure himself

280
00:17:12,047 --> 00:17:14,481
so don't go off
worrying unnecessarily.

281
00:17:14,527 --> 00:17:18,440
- I'd better give him a call.
- I wouldn't go calling him, Jim.

282
00:17:18,487 --> 00:17:20,398
And why not?

283
00:17:22,087 --> 00:17:24,601
He... He can't use the phone.

284
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:29,038
He's gone deaf.

285
00:17:30,167 --> 00:17:31,964
Dr Sinnott's gone deaf?

286
00:17:33,127 --> 00:17:35,163
That's terrible.

287
00:17:36,567 --> 00:17:37,886
It is.

288
00:17:37,927 --> 00:17:40,760
Oh, wait a second! There he is now.

289
00:17:43,047 --> 00:17:44,878
Dr Sinnott!

290
00:17:44,927 --> 00:17:47,202
He heard that all right, Ted.

291
00:17:47,247 --> 00:17:49,442
Doctor, would you have a moment?

292
00:17:49,487 --> 00:17:53,036
Wait, I've just remembered. Ha!

293
00:17:54,047 --> 00:17:56,436
Jim is not dying...

294
00:17:56,487 --> 00:17:58,478
and Dr Sinnott's not gone deaf.

295
00:17:59,727 --> 00:18:02,480
I was thinking
of two different people.

296
00:18:02,527 --> 00:18:05,280
So you will be able to say
tonight's Mass?

297
00:18:05,327 --> 00:18:08,637
Yes! Yes, I will. Of course.

298
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:12,680
Thanks to Father Dougal for clearing
up that misunderstanding.

299
00:18:14,087 --> 00:18:16,840
Ted. Ted, you're hurting me.

300
00:18:20,887 --> 00:18:23,162
I have to go straight after this.

301
00:18:23,207 --> 00:18:26,358
- You'll have to look after the nuns.
- Fair enough.

302
00:18:26,407 --> 00:18:29,205
- What'll I do with them?
- Whatever you want.

303
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:32,080
- Try not to kill them.
- No chance of that, Ted.

304
00:18:32,127 --> 00:18:34,516
- Remember Sister Janita?
- Oh, yeah.

305
00:18:34,567 --> 00:18:37,400
That was a bit too close
for comfort all right.

306
00:18:37,447 --> 00:18:39,438
Just be careful this time.

307
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:41,603
Oh, God. Are they all in there?

308
00:18:41,647 --> 00:18:44,002
Yeah. Like peas in a pub, Ted.

309
00:18:44,047 --> 00:18:45,958
Pod.

310
00:18:47,007 --> 00:18:49,965
- Let's go. See you later.
- Ok. Good luck, Ted.

311
00:18:58,087 --> 00:18:59,566
(Ted mutters )

312
00:18:59,607 --> 00:19:01,165
(Congregation mutters )

313
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:03,562
(Exchange becomes faster and faster)

314
00:19:07,847 --> 00:19:09,644
Right!

315
00:19:20,687 --> 00:19:21,756
Please.

316
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:23,996
Please.

317
00:19:25,167 --> 00:19:27,806
Please. Please.

318
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:30,958
- Pl...
- (Tyres screech)

319
00:19:31,007 --> 00:19:33,760
Sorry about that, Father.
Didn't see you.

320
00:19:34,767 --> 00:19:38,442
No problem, Tom.
Could you give me a lift?

321
00:19:38,487 --> 00:19:41,445
- Thanks again for the lift, Tom.
- No problem.

322
00:19:41,487 --> 00:19:43,876
I just have to pop into
the post office.

323
00:19:43,927 --> 00:19:45,804
- It's...
- I'll be a second.

324
00:19:47,567 --> 00:19:50,081
I'm meeting someone.
God, that's heavy.

325
00:19:50,127 --> 00:19:51,606
(Tyres screech)

326
00:19:52,607 --> 00:19:55,644
Won't be long. And you, shut up!

327
00:20:00,767 --> 00:20:02,723
(Gunshots )

328
00:20:03,767 --> 00:20:05,564
(Alarm ringing)

329
00:20:07,647 --> 00:20:10,719
You haven't been up to
your old tricks again, Tom?

330
00:20:10,767 --> 00:20:14,919
No. It's my money, I just didn't
want to fill out the forms.

331
00:20:20,167 --> 00:20:21,566
(Tyres screech)

332
00:20:21,607 --> 00:20:22,801
(Crash)

333
00:20:25,407 --> 00:20:27,523
You came!

334
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:32,403
Come in and have a drink,
Father Curley.

335
00:20:35,287 --> 00:20:38,563
I think I might have
everything you want in here.

336
00:20:40,527 --> 00:20:42,245
(Jolly music)

337
00:20:43,167 --> 00:20:45,283
Ted! This is great, isn't it?

338
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,045
What are you doing here?

339
00:20:47,087 --> 00:20:49,999
- What? Well, we were invited.
- Invited?

340
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:53,437
Same as you. Can't have
a house-warming on your own.

341
00:20:53,487 --> 00:20:55,205
No, I suppose not.

342
00:20:55,247 --> 00:20:57,283
Very short Mass tonight, Father.

343
00:20:57,327 --> 00:21:00,558
We were all a bit disappointed.
Weren't we, Sisters?

344
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,918
We might not come back next year.

345
00:21:03,967 --> 00:21:06,925
They say Father Clippit
does a good, long Mass.

346
00:21:06,967 --> 00:21:11,802
Three hours on a good night since
his stroke. That's value for money.

347
00:21:11,847 --> 00:21:16,079
- You see...
- I'm sorry, Father. I'm in a hurry.

348
00:21:16,127 --> 00:21:18,163
How do you get these open?

349
00:21:18,207 --> 00:21:19,606
(Pop )

350
00:21:23,167 --> 00:21:25,556
Bye, Sister. Bye, Sisters.

351
00:21:27,167 --> 00:21:28,759
Now, Father.

352
00:21:28,807 --> 00:21:30,399
(Mumbles )

353
00:21:33,047 --> 00:21:35,845
Father, before you go,
could I have a word?

354
00:21:35,887 --> 00:21:38,003
All right. Dougal, you go on ahead.

355
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:40,242
- I'll be back in a while.
- Right so.

356
00:21:43,047 --> 00:21:45,959
Would you like me
to put something else on?

357
00:21:46,007 --> 00:21:47,804
No, what you're wearing is fine.

358
00:21:49,447 --> 00:21:51,915
Would you like another drink,
Father Curley?

359
00:21:53,887 --> 00:21:55,036
Yes.

360
00:21:55,087 --> 00:21:57,317
It was nice talking to you today.

361
00:21:57,367 --> 00:22:00,359
If you can't talk to a priest,
who can you talk to?

362
00:22:00,407 --> 00:22:04,286
We're taught how to listen.
Not that we had listening classes.

363
00:22:04,327 --> 00:22:07,399
It's not as if we didn't know
how to listen before.

364
00:22:07,447 --> 00:22:10,598
It's just being there
and somebody talking to you,

365
00:22:10,647 --> 00:22:12,717
which is easy unless you're deaf.

366
00:22:12,767 --> 00:22:15,918
There's not an awful lot
of work involved there.

367
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:19,357
No swotting for those exams
with the old listening.

368
00:22:23,847 --> 00:22:27,157
Father, d'you remember me telling you

369
00:22:27,207 --> 00:22:30,643
about reaching a crossroads
in my life?

370
00:22:30,687 --> 00:22:32,598
Yes, I do.

371
00:22:32,647 --> 00:22:35,366
What do you think I should do?
I need advice.

372
00:22:41,567 --> 00:22:44,161
You know, Father, that's interesting.

373
00:22:44,207 --> 00:22:48,439
I think one road leads back
to where I was, that's a busy road.

374
00:22:48,487 --> 00:22:52,366
It's filled with people
and bright lights and traffic.

375
00:22:52,407 --> 00:22:54,967
The other road
is a quiet, country road

376
00:22:55,007 --> 00:22:58,920
with peace and serenity
and fulfilment.

377
00:22:58,967 --> 00:23:01,686
- I see.
- Which one would you choose?

378
00:23:01,727 --> 00:23:04,560
Well, it's... That's an easy one.

379
00:23:05,567 --> 00:23:07,637
Yes, I suppose it is obvious.

380
00:23:07,687 --> 00:23:09,757
Bright lights, glamour...

381
00:23:09,807 --> 00:23:12,719
- I was thinking...
- Cocaine parties, drugs, Las Vegas.

382
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:15,918
- No. Father. Father.
- Sorry.

383
00:23:15,967 --> 00:23:18,356
What I was going to say was,

384
00:23:18,407 --> 00:23:20,967
I know I've made the right choice.

385
00:23:21,007 --> 00:23:23,726
I know you have...Polly.

386
00:23:24,967 --> 00:23:27,720
I'm with you...all the way.

387
00:23:27,767 --> 00:23:30,076
I'm going to become a nun.

388
00:23:33,647 --> 00:23:35,046
Oh, feck!

389
00:23:35,087 --> 00:23:39,683
Feck...fecking marvellous news.

390
00:23:40,167 --> 00:23:43,716
I was talking
to Sister Julia earlier.

391
00:23:43,767 --> 00:23:46,281
You know she's 97 years of age?

392
00:23:46,327 --> 00:23:50,878
Did you ever think what it would be
like to be a 97-year-old nun, Father?

393
00:23:51,927 --> 00:23:52,996
No.

394
00:23:53,047 --> 00:23:54,719
I'll miss Craggy Island.

395
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:58,919
It's silly, I know.
I've only been here a day. But...

396
00:23:59,967 --> 00:24:02,083
I'll always remember you.

397
00:24:03,127 --> 00:24:07,086
In 20 years' time,
when I'm looking in my prayer book,

398
00:24:07,127 --> 00:24:11,643
I'll probably still be thinking
about Father Ted Curley.

399
00:24:14,207 --> 00:24:15,401
Crilly.

400
00:24:15,447 --> 00:24:16,846
What?

401
00:24:16,887 --> 00:24:19,321
Father Ted Crilly, nice to meet you.

402
00:24:23,527 --> 00:24:25,040
(Laughter)

403
00:24:31,007 --> 00:24:33,840
Oh, no, Dougal. Not again.

404
00:24:33,887 --> 00:24:37,721
Sorry, Ted. I was just looking
for some change.

405
00:24:39,807 --> 00:24:42,275
Oh, well. Back to the everyday grind.

406
00:24:42,327 --> 00:24:43,965
(Jack laughs )

(Silence )

2
00:00:05,727 --> 00:00:07,445
..eck! Arse.

3
00:00:07,487 --> 00:00:10,797
- These do work.
- You're right there, Ted.

4
00:00:10,847 --> 00:00:13,486
Feck! Arse! Feck!

5
00:00:13,527 --> 00:00:15,085
(Silence )

(Sighs )

9
00:01:14,167 --> 00:01:15,566
So, you're a nun?

10
00:01:17,607 --> 00:01:20,519
Right, Sister Monica.
I've left your bags in the hall.

11
00:01:20,567 --> 00:01:23,286
I thought you might like
to see the Holy Stone.

12
00:01:23,327 --> 00:01:26,080
- The what?
- The Holy Stone of Clonrichert.

13
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:28,925
- Great!
- One of the holiest rocks in Europe.

14
00:01:28,967 --> 00:01:30,958
You can get souvenir combs.

15
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:34,682
They're fantastic.
I got one last year. They've written,

16
00:01:34,727 --> 00:01:38,003
"I saw the Holy Stone
of Clonrichert."

17
00:01:38,047 --> 00:01:42,245
The Stone is great. We've seen it
I think, about 300 times.

18
00:01:42,287 --> 00:01:44,755
Why not? It would round off
the weekend.

19
00:01:44,807 --> 00:01:47,924
If you thought the ludo night
was exciting...

20
00:01:47,967 --> 00:01:50,356
this'll drive you
right over the edge.

21
00:01:50,407 --> 00:01:52,875
It's all been leading up
to the Holy Stone.

22
00:01:52,927 --> 00:01:55,316
What's so holy about it, Father?

23
00:01:55,367 --> 00:01:56,846
It's a general holiness.

24
00:01:56,887 --> 00:01:59,606
Father Dougal stood beside it
for ten minutes

25
00:01:59,647 --> 00:02:01,763
and got a great sense of serenity.

26
00:02:01,807 --> 00:02:04,526
Yes, I got a great buzz off it.

27
00:02:04,567 --> 00:02:07,127
Why is it called the Holy Stone
of Clonrichert?

28
00:02:07,167 --> 00:02:09,727
I thought Clonrichert
was in Fermanagh.

29
00:02:09,767 --> 00:02:12,884
It is. The Holy Stone was up there.

30
00:02:12,927 --> 00:02:15,157
But it wasn't doing great business.

31
00:02:16,367 --> 00:02:20,758
- So, treat in store for you.
- Wonderful. That'll be wonderful.

32
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,798
I'll just go and freshen up.

33
00:02:28,207 --> 00:02:30,846
She'll be putting on make-up,
I suppose.

34
00:02:32,087 --> 00:02:34,078
Impress the lads, huh?

35
00:02:35,327 --> 00:02:38,319
Ah, no. She's probably
just going to the toilet.

36
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:40,164
Aren't nuns great?

37
00:02:40,207 --> 00:02:43,722
You don't feel as nervous with them
as you do with real women.

38
00:02:46,247 --> 00:02:48,044
You're right there.

39
00:02:48,087 --> 00:02:52,365
I just got the courage to talk to
her, but it's nice having her around.

40
00:02:52,407 --> 00:02:55,524
Gives the place a bit of glamour.

41
00:02:55,567 --> 00:02:57,364
A woman's touch.

42
00:02:58,607 --> 00:03:03,237
Anyway, I'd better go and rouse Jack.
Tell him we're off.

43
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,836
Ted says you were touching him.

44
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:30,163
Father Jack, you all right?
Ready for another day?

45
00:03:30,207 --> 00:03:32,198
I'm off with Sister Monica.

46
00:03:32,247 --> 00:03:35,478
If the milkman calls, the money's
under the statue of our Lord

47
00:03:35,527 --> 00:03:37,597
being embarrassed by the Romans.

48
00:03:37,647 --> 00:03:40,241
Would you like a cup of tea
before I go?

49
00:03:41,207 --> 00:03:42,526
Morning, Father.

50
00:03:42,567 --> 00:03:45,127
(Ted) You won't mind us
leaving you alone

51
00:03:45,167 --> 00:03:48,796
because Dougal got that new video
for you, Reservoir Dogs.

52
00:03:49,847 --> 00:03:53,601
It's probably not as violent
as the ones you usually like,

53
00:03:53,647 --> 00:03:55,603
but sure give it a go.

54
00:03:56,567 --> 00:03:58,000
What are you doing?

55
00:03:58,047 --> 00:04:00,402
- This looks bad.
- What?

56
00:04:00,447 --> 00:04:01,846
He's very drunk.

57
00:04:01,887 --> 00:04:06,005
all night. Where does he hide it?

58
00:04:06,047 --> 00:04:10,882
I haven't seen him this bad since
he disappeared with Sister Imelda.

59
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:14,118
God, yes. The blue nun.

60
00:04:15,767 --> 00:04:19,203
- Oh, no, Ted. Look at this.
- Oh, God.

61
00:04:19,247 --> 00:04:22,762
Hold this. Father, this is very bad.

62
00:04:22,807 --> 00:04:25,958
Do you not remember what
the Windolene did to you?

63
00:04:26,007 --> 00:04:28,077
Father Jack, are you there?

64
00:04:28,127 --> 00:04:31,802
- Ted.
- Imagine the damage polish would do.

65
00:04:31,847 --> 00:04:34,156
- Ted.
- What is it?

66
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:36,323
I'm in tremendous pain, Ted.

67
00:04:37,887 --> 00:04:39,764
- Put it down then.
- Oh.

68
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:43,083
God, Dougal.
Come on, get him under the arms.

69
00:04:43,127 --> 00:04:47,200
Come on, Father. We can't have
Sister Monica seeing you like this.

70
00:04:47,247 --> 00:04:48,839
What's the matter?

71
00:04:48,887 --> 00:04:51,447
There you are.
It's Father Jack's motor.

72
00:04:51,487 --> 00:04:53,796
Takes a while to start
in the morning.

73
00:04:53,847 --> 00:04:56,600
- He doesn't look well.
- (Chuckles ) He's grand.

74
00:04:56,647 --> 00:05:00,162
We're taking him on a trip
to the toilet. Right, Father?

75
00:05:00,207 --> 00:05:03,995
Would you put him down in that chair
and we'll have a look at him.

76
00:05:04,047 --> 00:05:06,083
He doesn't like to be fussed over.

77
00:05:06,127 --> 00:05:08,402
I think you should
let me look at him.

78
00:05:12,167 --> 00:05:14,556
Holy Mother of God, he's dead.

79
00:05:14,607 --> 00:05:16,643
What's the problem there, Sister?

80
00:05:16,687 --> 00:05:21,283
Father Jack is dead!
There's no pulse and he's stone cold.

81
00:05:21,327 --> 00:05:23,761
Come on, Father.
You're not dead, are you?

82
00:05:23,807 --> 00:05:27,197
- He's very definitely dead.
- The joke's over.

83
00:05:27,247 --> 00:05:29,442
He's gone.
You should get help

84
00:05:29,487 --> 00:05:32,206
and Father Dougal
can give the sacraments.

85
00:05:32,247 --> 00:05:34,078
Right, I'll call Dr Sinnott,

86
00:05:34,127 --> 00:05:37,756
but frankly I think you're making
a big fuss about nothing.

87
00:05:48,087 --> 00:05:49,600
The last rites, Father.

88
00:05:49,647 --> 00:05:53,560
Oh, right. Yeah, of course.
Shouldn't we wait for Ted?

89
00:05:53,607 --> 00:05:56,485
There's no need.

90
00:05:56,527 --> 00:05:58,757
No. Himself drank it last week.

91
00:06:00,607 --> 00:06:03,246
You wouldn't like
to do the honours yourself?

92
00:06:03,287 --> 00:06:05,278
- What?
- No, of course not.

93
00:06:05,327 --> 00:06:08,956
I suppose I'm wearing the trousers
as far as this job goes.

94
00:06:10,367 --> 00:06:12,085
Right.

95
00:06:14,887 --> 00:06:18,562
Well, we are gathered here today
to join two people...

96
00:06:19,287 --> 00:06:21,084
Sorry, that's not it.

97
00:06:22,847 --> 00:06:25,884
Well, Father, best of luck.

98
00:06:28,047 --> 00:06:30,038
Oh, of course. There's more.

99
00:06:30,087 --> 00:06:32,237
Sorry I didn't see you off.

100
00:06:32,287 --> 00:06:36,121
Don't know if I should be talking
to you down here or up there.

101
00:06:36,167 --> 00:06:37,520
I'll look up there.

102
00:06:38,647 --> 00:06:40,638
Anyway, you're there now

103
00:06:40,687 --> 00:06:44,999
with our Lord and Stalin and
Bob Marley and the rest of them...

104
00:06:45,047 --> 00:06:47,242
and of course my own parents.

105
00:06:47,287 --> 00:06:51,166
Actually I'd like to take this
opportunity to say hello to them.

106
00:06:51,207 --> 00:06:53,880
Hello, Mammy and, er, Daddy.

107
00:06:53,927 --> 00:06:55,918
Hope they're looking after you.

108
00:06:55,967 --> 00:06:58,322
The Latin, Father.

109
00:06:58,367 --> 00:07:00,244
Oh, right. Yeah.

110
00:07:01,647 --> 00:07:07,483
Totus tuus minimus canus,
costa curta Baggio, Roberto...

111
00:07:10,327 --> 00:07:13,444
- Did you ring the doctor?
- Right. It looks bad.

112
00:07:13,487 --> 00:07:17,082
I called Dr Sinnott, I gave him
the symptoms over the phone

113
00:07:17,127 --> 00:07:19,687
and he said he's probably
dead all right.

114
00:07:19,727 --> 00:07:22,195
The pulse not being there
is bad enough,

115
00:07:22,247 --> 00:07:25,159
but the heart stopping
is the real danger sign.

116
00:07:25,207 --> 00:07:27,641
That happened to my uncle
and he was fine.

117
00:07:27,687 --> 00:07:29,723
His heart stopped? For how long?

118
00:07:29,767 --> 00:07:31,280
Er...a week.

119
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:33,716
A week?
And he was fine afterwards?

120
00:07:33,767 --> 00:07:37,726
Actually, no.
Now I think of it, he died.

121
00:07:46,247 --> 00:07:49,080
I think it's absolutely great to see.

122
00:07:49,127 --> 00:07:52,881
I mean, the level of commitment
amongst the African Church.

123
00:07:52,927 --> 00:07:55,521
You're bringing the faith
to the people.

124
00:07:55,567 --> 00:07:57,478
It's marvellous, isn't it?

125
00:07:57,527 --> 00:08:00,200
Sure I wouldn't know,
I'm from Donegal.

126
00:08:04,767 --> 00:08:07,486
Will you have a sandwich,
Father Cleary?

127
00:08:07,527 --> 00:08:12,078
- No, thanks, Mrs Doyle. I'm fine.
- Have a try. They're diagonal.

128
00:08:12,127 --> 00:08:15,483
So I see. But no thanks, anyway.

129
00:08:15,527 --> 00:08:17,358
Go on. They're only small.

130
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:20,160
- I'm fine.
- Are you sure you won't have one?

131
00:08:20,207 --> 00:08:22,880
No thanks. I ate before I came out.

132
00:08:22,927 --> 00:08:26,317
- I could put one in a bag for later.
- No, don't bother.

133
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:29,006
Here's a little bag
you can bring one home in.

134
00:08:29,047 --> 00:08:31,038
- No, no.
- Here's a bigger bag

135
00:08:31,087 --> 00:08:33,203
- to put the little bag in.
- No.

136
00:08:33,247 --> 00:08:36,000
You can eat it later or now.
Whatever suits.

137
00:08:36,047 --> 00:08:37,605
Oh...

138
00:08:37,647 --> 00:08:39,444
You'll have one now.

139
00:08:40,527 --> 00:08:42,563
Sure, I might as well.

140
00:08:42,607 --> 00:08:44,006
Mrs Doyle.

141
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,842
Father Mackey would like a sandwich.

142
00:08:47,887 --> 00:08:50,685
Father Mackey,
will you have a sandwich?

143
00:08:52,167 --> 00:08:54,556
I'm terribly sorry I'm late, Ted.

144
00:08:54,607 --> 00:08:57,917
The car. The car broke down.

145
00:08:57,967 --> 00:09:00,242
That's all right.
Father Fay, how are you?

146
00:09:00,287 --> 00:09:02,642
(Mumbles )

147
00:09:03,887 --> 00:09:05,479
He is. It was very quick.

148
00:09:05,527 --> 00:09:07,802
(Gibberish)

149
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:09,075
Yes, I suppose so.

150
00:09:09,127 --> 00:09:11,038
Oooo... Ee-ur...?

151
00:09:11,087 --> 00:09:13,647
In New Zealand
and a sister in South Africa.

152
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:19,239
Why him, Ted?
Why is it always the good ones?

153
00:09:19,287 --> 00:09:21,517
You bastard!

154
00:09:22,807 --> 00:09:24,399
Father!

155
00:09:24,447 --> 00:09:27,325
He could've been Pope, Ted.

156
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:31,201
But the fecking Jesuits,
they have it all tied up.

157
00:09:31,247 --> 00:09:33,522
- Yes.
- Imagine, Ted.

158
00:09:33,567 --> 00:09:35,558
A Polish Pope.

159
00:09:35,607 --> 00:09:37,882
It should've been Jack!

160
00:09:37,927 --> 00:09:41,363
But it's not what you know, is it?
It's who you know.

161
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:45,119
It's sad, but look at him.
He looks serene.

162
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:49,638
(Wails) Oh, God! No, no, no!

163
00:09:49,687 --> 00:09:52,520
No! He's dead, Ted.

164
00:09:52,567 --> 00:09:54,637
We'll never see him again.

165
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,915
(Sobs )

166
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:59,516
- We'll see him in the next world.
- Oh, yeah, sure.

167
00:09:59,567 --> 00:10:00,795
(Shouting)

168
00:10:00,847 --> 00:10:03,919
Oh, God. No. Get him down.

169
00:10:03,967 --> 00:10:05,685
Get him down. Get him down.

170
00:10:05,727 --> 00:10:07,797
(Shouting)

171
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:29,758
Feck off.

172
00:10:30,727 --> 00:10:32,604
Gimme lots of drink.

173
00:10:32,647 --> 00:10:34,797
Arse! Feck! Drink!

174
00:10:34,847 --> 00:10:37,998
Feck off. Ted, you big fool.

175
00:10:39,567 --> 00:10:41,046
What are you doing?

176
00:10:41,087 --> 00:10:44,045
You shouldn't be getting up
to this nonsense. Up you get.

177
00:10:44,087 --> 00:10:46,885
We should leave his chair
idle for a while.

178
00:10:46,927 --> 00:10:50,158
Would you look at that.
Completely bald.

179
00:10:50,207 --> 00:10:52,118
Smooth as a baby's behind.

180
00:10:52,167 --> 00:10:53,725
You'd know about that.

181
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:57,647
- What?
- You know, when you baptise them.

182
00:10:57,687 --> 00:11:01,566
Oh. Now, I'm going to give
Sister Monica a lift.

183
00:11:01,607 --> 00:11:04,041
- Down to the boat.
- Thank you, Father.

184
00:11:04,087 --> 00:11:08,638
It's the least we could do. You were
always very good to Father Jack.

185
00:11:08,687 --> 00:11:12,282
Excuse me, Father Crilly,
there's a woman here to see you.

186
00:11:12,327 --> 00:11:15,160
A woman, Mrs Doyle.
I think you mean a nun.

187
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:18,279
Oh, no, no, no, no.
It's a woman all right.

188
00:11:18,327 --> 00:11:21,285
A young woman...with a skirt.

189
00:11:21,327 --> 00:11:23,283
I'll be off then.

190
00:11:25,807 --> 00:11:27,843
- Hello, Father Crilly?
- Yes.

191
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:30,526
I'm from Corless,
Corless and Sweeney.

192
00:11:30,567 --> 00:11:32,319
We're fine for coal, thanks.

193
00:11:32,367 --> 00:11:35,325
No. It's nothing to do with coal.

194
00:11:35,367 --> 00:11:40,157
My name is Laura Sweeney.
This must be Father McGuire.

195
00:11:42,167 --> 00:11:45,637
I think you both better sit down.
I've got a shock for you.

196
00:11:45,687 --> 00:11:49,316
I want to assure you that was
a routine relocation of funds.

197
00:11:49,367 --> 00:11:50,436
No, no.

198
00:11:50,487 --> 00:11:53,923
The money was resting
in my account before...

199
00:11:53,967 --> 00:11:57,323
You don't understand.
This is about Father Hackett.

200
00:11:57,367 --> 00:12:00,279
Please, sit down
and I'll explain everything.

201
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:08,006
It may come as a surprise for you
that Father Hackett left a will.

202
00:12:08,047 --> 00:12:10,197
Did he? What does it say?

203
00:12:10,247 --> 00:12:12,841
Well, if I may...

204
00:12:12,887 --> 00:12:16,197
"I, Father Jack Hackett,
being of sound mind and body..."

205
00:12:19,127 --> 00:12:20,321
Sorry.

206
00:12:21,767 --> 00:12:26,079
"..leave my entire fortune to Father
Ted Crilly and Father Dougal McGuire

207
00:12:26,127 --> 00:12:29,039
"to be distributed equally
amongst them and..."

208
00:12:31,767 --> 00:12:34,725
I'll be off now, then, Father.

209
00:12:36,927 --> 00:12:39,566
I'll make the way
to the boat myself, then.

210
00:12:39,607 --> 00:12:41,404
Yeah, yeah.

211
00:12:42,967 --> 00:12:45,527
- Bye, Fathers.
- Yeah, bye.

212
00:12:46,847 --> 00:12:48,041
Listen, Dougal.

213
00:12:48,087 --> 00:12:50,237
Father Jack left us money.

214
00:12:50,287 --> 00:12:52,676
That's very nice of him. How much?

215
00:12:52,727 --> 00:12:54,240
Ha...

216
00:12:54,287 --> 00:12:57,006
Half... Half a million pounds.

217
00:12:58,047 --> 00:13:00,925
Half a million pounds each!

218
00:13:00,967 --> 00:13:02,764
No, between us.

219
00:13:07,607 --> 00:13:11,395
It's only a quarter
of a million each, Ted. Ted.

220
00:13:11,447 --> 00:13:12,641
Ted?

221
00:13:17,167 --> 00:13:20,921
That's that. It looks like
you're going to be very rich men.

222
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,002
Grand.

223
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:26,245
There's one requirement, which I'm
surprised you didn't discuss.

224
00:13:26,287 --> 00:13:28,642
- Oh?
- When is the funeral again?

225
00:13:28,687 --> 00:13:32,202
Again? We haven't had
the first one yet, so...

226
00:13:32,247 --> 00:13:36,638
No. Sorry, maybe I didn't
make myself clear.

227
00:13:36,687 --> 00:13:39,042
- It's tomorrow morning.
- Right.

228
00:13:39,087 --> 00:13:42,796
You know about Father Hackett's fear
of being buried alive.

229
00:13:42,847 --> 00:13:46,283
There's no chance of that now.
You know... He's dead.

230
00:13:47,567 --> 00:13:50,604
Oh, yes. That's why he wouldn't
do confession.

231
00:13:50,647 --> 00:13:54,799
He didn't like enclosed spaces. But
he also just didn't want to do it.

232
00:13:55,847 --> 00:13:59,442
Strangers telling you their sins.
Who'd be bothered with that?

233
00:13:59,487 --> 00:14:03,321
Well, Father Hackett's fear
was so great,

234
00:14:03,367 --> 00:14:07,883
he stipulated that you two must spend
the night before the burial with him.

235
00:14:07,927 --> 00:14:12,079
Ok. That's the least we can do. We
can discuss it with the solicitor.

236
00:14:13,087 --> 00:14:15,362
No, I am the solicitor.

237
00:14:15,407 --> 00:14:17,363
(Sniggers )

238
00:14:18,807 --> 00:14:20,126
No, you're not.

239
00:14:21,287 --> 00:14:25,678
I'm sorry, I am a senior partner
in Corless, Corless and Sweeney.

240
00:14:25,727 --> 00:14:27,718
Now, come on, now.

241
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:32,680
Just because we're from the island,
you think you can have fun with us.

242
00:14:32,727 --> 00:14:34,046
I assure you...

243
00:14:34,087 --> 00:14:38,239
All right. The big thickos
from the island.

244
00:14:38,287 --> 00:14:41,563
- But we're not as thick as we look.
- No way, Jose.

245
00:14:41,607 --> 00:14:46,158
Wait a second! Why do you think I've
been talking to you all this time?

246
00:14:46,207 --> 00:14:48,198
Look, you're a lovely girl,

247
00:14:48,247 --> 00:14:51,523
but I think we should
talk to the solicitor.

248
00:14:51,567 --> 00:14:53,956
If you're a solicitor,
I'm Boy George.

249
00:14:56,727 --> 00:15:00,083
# karma karma karma karma karma
Chameleon

250
00:15:00,127 --> 00:15:02,277
# You come and go

251
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:04,518
# You come and go

252
00:15:04,567 --> 00:15:07,718
# karma karma karma karma
Chameleon... #

253
00:15:07,767 --> 00:15:09,439
(Ted sighs )

254
00:15:09,487 --> 00:15:12,604
- How's your head, Ted?
- Not too bad.

255
00:15:12,647 --> 00:15:16,765
It's true what they say about
career women. Very aggressive.

256
00:15:16,807 --> 00:15:19,446
- She was very aggressive.
- The language!

257
00:15:19,487 --> 00:15:21,478
You wouldn't hear it from a docker.

258
00:15:21,527 --> 00:15:23,995
You would.
They use very bad language.

259
00:15:24,847 --> 00:15:26,838
"Effing this" and "Effing that".

260
00:15:26,887 --> 00:15:28,843
It was worse. She was saying fu...

261
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:30,878
Now, Dougal!

262
00:15:35,447 --> 00:15:38,803
Who'd have thought Father Jack
had half a million pounds?

263
00:15:38,847 --> 00:15:40,644
He never said a word about it.

264
00:15:40,687 --> 00:15:43,042
Lying in a bank account
all these years.

265
00:15:43,087 --> 00:15:45,317
How did he get it
in the first place?

266
00:15:45,367 --> 00:15:48,518
As far as I understand,
he was just an astute saver.

267
00:15:48,567 --> 00:15:50,683
Tried to avoid giving money
to charity,

268
00:15:50,727 --> 00:15:53,366
he wouldn't wear trousers
during summer,

269
00:15:53,407 --> 00:15:56,240
that saved a couple of bob
in wear and tear.

270
00:15:56,287 --> 00:15:59,643
All sorts of savings
all over the place. It all adds up.

271
00:16:00,847 --> 00:16:04,123
I suppose we only knew him
in his twilight years.

272
00:16:04,167 --> 00:16:06,476
But I think we saw the best of him.

273
00:16:06,527 --> 00:16:09,997
The really lovely man.
True knight of the Church.

274
00:16:10,047 --> 00:16:13,278
Gentle, lovely sense of humour.

275
00:16:13,327 --> 00:16:15,397
Patient, good-natured.

276
00:16:15,447 --> 00:16:17,483
Sorry, Ted. Who's this now?

277
00:16:19,847 --> 00:16:23,078
Who do you think I'd be talking about
at this moment?

278
00:16:23,127 --> 00:16:25,322
I'm not sure.
I didn't catch the start.

279
00:16:26,767 --> 00:16:28,166
Jack, of course.

280
00:16:28,207 --> 00:16:29,765
Oh, right. Yes.

281
00:16:29,807 --> 00:16:31,957
A great priest.

282
00:16:32,887 --> 00:16:35,242
First priest to denounce The Beatles.

283
00:16:35,287 --> 00:16:37,960
- Right.
- He could see what they were up to.

284
00:16:39,287 --> 00:16:41,118
He loved children, of course.

285
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,361
He did, yes.

286
00:16:42,407 --> 00:16:44,398
They were terrified of him, though.

287
00:16:44,447 --> 00:16:46,881
He had that stick
and he'd be waving it.

288
00:16:46,927 --> 00:16:49,157
Maybe they thought he'd hit them.

289
00:16:49,207 --> 00:16:51,437
I heard that when he was teaching

290
00:16:51,487 --> 00:16:53,876
he was a great believer
in discipline.

291
00:16:53,927 --> 00:16:55,997
(Muttering)

292
00:16:58,647 --> 00:17:00,763
Would you say he was a good teacher?

293
00:17:00,807 --> 00:17:04,846
Friend of mine, Father Jimmy
Rannable, studied under him.

294
00:17:04,887 --> 00:17:06,639
He told me once,

295
00:17:06,687 --> 00:17:10,362
no one, no one had such
a huge effect on him as Father Jack.

296
00:17:11,367 --> 00:17:13,961
Jimmy Rannable.
What happened to him?

297
00:17:14,007 --> 00:17:17,636
- Remember the Drumshanbo Massacre?
- Yeah.

298
00:17:17,687 --> 00:17:20,155
- That was him.
- Oh.

299
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:23,802
Another thing about Jack,
he loved a bit of competition.

300
00:17:23,847 --> 00:17:26,042
He'd a great sense of fair play.

301
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:28,476
(Angelic choir)

302
00:17:36,287 --> 00:17:37,845
A great traditionalist.

303
00:17:37,887 --> 00:17:41,516
He didn't agree with the modern
thinking within the Church.

304
00:17:41,567 --> 00:17:44,718
You'll burn for all eternity in hell!

305
00:17:46,127 --> 00:17:48,004
Hell!

306
00:17:49,887 --> 00:17:53,516
Funny, one moment you're here,
the next moment...

307
00:17:54,567 --> 00:17:57,161
"And in the happy no-time
of his sleeping

308
00:17:57,207 --> 00:18:00,085
"Death took him by the heart."

309
00:18:00,127 --> 00:18:04,325
You know, someone once said that life
is but a thin sliver of light

310
00:18:04,367 --> 00:18:06,927
between two immensities of darkness.

311
00:18:06,967 --> 00:18:09,003
Makes you think.

312
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:11,038
Does, Ted.

313
00:18:11,767 --> 00:18:12,961
About what?

314
00:18:14,247 --> 00:18:16,807
About death, Dougal. About death.

315
00:18:16,847 --> 00:18:20,886
That's very morbid. What started you
off thinking about death?

316
00:18:30,927 --> 00:18:34,158
Still, it's good we have
this time with him.

317
00:18:34,207 --> 00:18:38,678
Maybe sometimes we weren't always
as thoughtful as we could have been.

318
00:18:38,727 --> 00:18:41,799
At least now we're able
to have this time with him.

319
00:18:41,847 --> 00:18:44,361
Treat him with the respect
he deserves.

320
00:18:44,407 --> 00:18:46,557
You're right there, Ted.

321
00:18:50,487 --> 00:18:52,603
D'you fancy now a game of charades?

322
00:18:52,647 --> 00:18:56,356
- Yes, I think so!
- Right so, you go first.

323
00:18:56,407 --> 00:18:59,046
Right. I'll start.

324
00:18:59,087 --> 00:19:01,157
I'll give you an easy one.

325
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:02,799
Fishing!

326
00:19:02,847 --> 00:19:04,360
Gone fishing.

327
00:19:04,967 --> 00:19:06,958
Boxing... One-handed boxing.

328
00:19:07,007 --> 00:19:10,238
- It's a film.
- You're not supposed to tell me.

329
00:19:14,447 --> 00:19:15,960
Ok.

330
00:19:16,007 --> 00:19:17,440
Film.

331
00:19:19,447 --> 00:19:23,281
- One film.
- One word.

332
00:19:23,327 --> 00:19:27,036
Come on, Ted. You're making it
a bit too easy for me.

333
00:19:27,087 --> 00:19:29,362
I'm not an idiot, you know.
One-word film.

334
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:31,523
Can't be too many of them.
Salem's Lot.

335
00:19:34,687 --> 00:19:36,279
Tongue. Mouth! Teeth!

336
00:19:36,327 --> 00:19:39,239
Is there a film called Tongue?
Tom Tongue.

337
00:19:39,287 --> 00:19:42,006
Er... Tongue Fish.

338
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:43,480
S-s-s-swim tongue.

339
00:19:43,527 --> 00:19:47,202
Er... Fish!
Attack of the giant killing fish.

340
00:19:47,247 --> 00:19:48,965
Tongue Fish. The Deep.

341
00:19:49,007 --> 00:19:50,804
Piranha. Jaws 2.

342
00:19:52,247 --> 00:19:53,566
Close, then.

343
00:19:53,607 --> 00:19:55,404
Ghostbusters 2!

344
00:19:57,167 --> 00:19:59,362
Superman 2! No.

345
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:01,398
Batman Returns.

346
00:20:01,447 --> 00:20:03,085
You had it, it was Jaws!

347
00:20:03,127 --> 00:20:05,277
No, I had Jaws 2. It's different.

348
00:20:05,327 --> 00:20:07,795
It's very different.
It's a different shark.

349
00:20:12,207 --> 00:20:14,437
Ted, are you still awake?

350
00:20:14,487 --> 00:20:19,083
- Yes, yes.
- Just wanted to ask you a question.

351
00:20:19,127 --> 00:20:21,482
Not again, Dougal.

352
00:20:21,527 --> 00:20:24,917
Look, when a man and a lady
are very much in love...

353
00:20:24,967 --> 00:20:26,605
No!

354
00:20:27,967 --> 00:20:30,162
No, I didn't want to ask that, Ted.

355
00:20:30,207 --> 00:20:33,324
I wanted to ask you,
do you believe in an afterlife?

356
00:20:33,367 --> 00:20:36,404
- Do I what?
- Do you believe in an afterlife?

357
00:20:36,447 --> 00:20:38,438
Dougal, generally speaking,

358
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:42,116
priests tend to have a strong belief
in the afterlife.

359
00:20:42,167 --> 00:20:44,317
I wish I had your faith, Ted.

360
00:20:45,367 --> 00:20:46,641
(Sighs )

361
00:20:46,687 --> 00:20:49,326
Dougal, how did you
get into the Church?

362
00:20:49,367 --> 00:20:52,803
Was it "collect twelve crisp packets
and become a priest"?

363
00:20:56,567 --> 00:20:58,478
Ted?

364
00:20:58,527 --> 00:21:00,961
Dougal, please let me go to sleep.

365
00:21:01,007 --> 00:21:05,717
I was wondering, what are you gonna
do with your share of the money?

366
00:21:05,767 --> 00:21:09,555
Well... Luckily, there are lots
of charity organisations

367
00:21:09,607 --> 00:21:11,518
that are grateful for money.

368
00:21:11,567 --> 00:21:17,915
There's Concern, St Vincent de Paul,
Food for Africa, Help the Aged.

369
00:21:17,967 --> 00:21:20,242
(Disco music)

370
00:21:26,447 --> 00:21:28,722
Maybe a few pounds for Comic Relief.

371
00:21:28,767 --> 00:21:31,759
So, some good will come
from Father Jack's death.

372
00:21:31,807 --> 00:21:34,844
It's hard to believe he's gone,
though, isn't it?

373
00:21:34,887 --> 00:21:37,037
You're right there.

374
00:21:39,487 --> 00:21:41,284
(Snoring)

375
00:21:42,247 --> 00:21:44,203
It's beginning to snow again.

376
00:21:44,247 --> 00:21:46,044
The flakes, silver and dark,

377
00:21:46,087 --> 00:21:48,999
are falling obliquely
against the lamplight.

378
00:21:49,047 --> 00:21:51,800
It's probably snowing
all over the island,

379
00:21:51,847 --> 00:21:55,078
on the central plain,
on the treeless hills,

380
00:21:55,127 --> 00:21:57,402
falling softly upon the graveyards,

381
00:21:57,447 --> 00:21:59,722
upon the crosses and the headstones,

382
00:21:59,767 --> 00:22:01,883
upon all the living

383
00:22:01,927 --> 00:22:04,077
and the dead.

384
00:22:04,127 --> 00:22:06,118
Shut the feck up!

385
00:22:07,167 --> 00:22:08,600
Ted! What's wrong?

386
00:22:08,647 --> 00:22:11,525
Father Jack, did you see
what happened? Ted?

387
00:22:12,687 --> 00:22:15,406
What happened, Father Jack?
Wha... Ooooo!

388
00:22:18,687 --> 00:22:20,006
(Snores )

389
00:22:22,447 --> 00:22:27,999
So, there he is, risen from the dead,
like that fella ET.

390
00:22:31,327 --> 00:22:33,761
There's one thing that confuses me.

391
00:22:33,807 --> 00:22:36,560
- Yes?
- Is Jack dead or what?

392
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:41,080
Apparently not.

393
00:22:41,127 --> 00:22:44,802
The floor polish brought about
all the symptoms of death,

394
00:22:44,847 --> 00:22:49,284
such as no heartbeat, rigor mortis,
decomposition,

395
00:22:49,327 --> 00:22:52,285
but he was lucky,
the effects just wore off him.

396
00:22:52,327 --> 00:22:54,716
It's good to have him back, isn't it?

397
00:22:54,767 --> 00:22:55,916
Mmm.

398
00:22:55,967 --> 00:22:58,481
Who needs half a million pounds,
anyway?

399
00:23:00,607 --> 00:23:03,041
Yes, our life is the spiritual life.

400
00:23:03,087 --> 00:23:04,964
(Disco music)

401
00:23:05,007 --> 00:23:09,637
But to be honest...
I don't like talking about this,

402
00:23:09,687 --> 00:23:11,643
but it's only a matter of time.

403
00:23:11,687 --> 00:23:13,837
I mean, he's not a young man.

404
00:23:13,887 --> 00:23:18,085
And, you know, I suppose,
when he's gone it won't be so bad.

405
00:23:19,407 --> 00:23:21,796
The money will be some comfort to us.

406
00:23:21,847 --> 00:23:23,439
That's something.

407
00:23:23,487 --> 00:23:25,921
Now, you'd better come to the shops.

408
00:23:25,967 --> 00:23:29,039
I want to buy some more floor polish.

409
00:23:29,087 --> 00:23:33,239
Maybe we should get a few different
brands, just to try them out, like.

410
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:36,085
Yes, we could leave them
all round the house.

411
00:23:36,127 --> 00:23:40,325
Or we could leave them in Jack's room
and ask him to keep an eye on them.

412
00:23:42,607 --> 00:23:44,245
Drink!

413
00:23:47,767 --> 00:23:48,995
Feck off!

414
00:24:19,247 --> 00:24:21,044
(Disco music)

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
