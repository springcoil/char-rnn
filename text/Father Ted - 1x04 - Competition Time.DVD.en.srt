1
00:00:25,447 --> 00:00:27,278
(Helicopter)

2
00:00:28,887 --> 00:00:30,400
(Crash)

3
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:33,644
- Ready when you are, Ted.

4
00:00:33,687 --> 00:00:36,281
You'll like this. Ok. Here I come!

5
00:00:41,767 --> 00:00:44,759
Who are you supposed to be, Ted?

6
00:00:44,807 --> 00:00:47,958
What are you doing?
You two can't go as Elvis.

7
00:00:48,007 --> 00:00:51,044
You... Wait a second.

8
00:00:51,087 --> 00:00:53,078
You're Elvis as well.

9
00:00:53,127 --> 00:00:57,405
Of course. I've got Elvis written
on my back. I don't believe this.

10
00:00:57,447 --> 00:01:01,042
Bit of a coincidence.
Great minds think alike, I suppose.

11
00:01:01,087 --> 00:01:04,636
I've been saying for two weeks
I was going as Elvis.

12
00:01:04,687 --> 00:01:07,201
That's probably where I got the idea.

13
00:01:07,247 --> 00:01:11,445
Great. The first All Priests Stars
in Their Eyes Lookalike Competition

14
00:01:11,487 --> 00:01:13,478
I thought I had a chance in.

15
00:01:13,527 --> 00:01:16,803
I even made space for the trophy
beside the one we got

16
00:01:16,847 --> 00:01:19,884
- for the ludo championships.
- You might win.

17
00:01:19,927 --> 00:01:22,566
If you're on before me,
I'll look an idiot.

18
00:01:22,607 --> 00:01:24,563
Everyone'll think I copied you.

19
00:01:24,607 --> 00:01:29,522
Well, to be fair, it is a bit weird
you happened to think of it as well.

20
00:01:30,527 --> 00:01:34,520
Right. I'll just have to go
as Mother Teresa again.

21
00:01:36,167 --> 00:01:38,886
Who are you supposed to be?

22
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:42,881
Elvis. I'm Elvis.

23
00:01:42,927 --> 00:01:46,317
- I'm Elvis.
- I know you're Elvis, Father.

24
00:01:46,367 --> 00:01:48,642
We're all Elvis. That's the problem.

25
00:01:48,687 --> 00:01:52,043
- Tea, Fathers.
- Feck off!

26
00:01:52,087 --> 00:01:55,238
There's nothing like a cup
of tea in the afternoon.

27
00:01:55,287 --> 00:01:58,324
You look a bit different, Father.

28
00:01:58,367 --> 00:02:00,881
Have you had a haircut or something?

29
00:02:00,927 --> 00:02:02,963
No. I'm Elvis Presley.

30
00:02:03,007 --> 00:02:06,636
Are you, Father? That's a turn-up
for the books anyway.

31
00:02:06,687 --> 00:02:08,837
It's for the Lookalike Show.

32
00:02:08,887 --> 00:02:12,675
Now I see. I must say
I'm looking forward to that.

33
00:02:12,727 --> 00:02:15,525
- Is Father kiernan coming?
- He won't be, no.

34
00:02:15,567 --> 00:02:19,196
He's a great laugh. I remember him
last year telling his stories.

35
00:02:19,247 --> 00:02:23,126
He had me in stitches. It is true
what they say about chubby men.

36
00:02:23,167 --> 00:02:27,604
They are jollier than the rest of us.
They've a way of looking at things.

37
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,239
He shot himself.

38
00:02:29,287 --> 00:02:32,563
Did he? Yeah. That's terrible.

39
00:02:32,607 --> 00:02:36,156
Still, I suppose that's
often the way with fat men.

40
00:02:36,207 --> 00:02:39,324
They laugh to hide the tears.
But that's life.

41
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:44,077
Happy one minute, and the next you go
and shoot yourself and that's that.

42
00:02:44,127 --> 00:02:45,845
Anyway, tea.

43
00:02:45,887 --> 00:02:47,878
(Phone )

44
00:02:51,367 --> 00:02:54,086
- Hello.
- Ted, how are you? Dick Byrne here.

45
00:02:54,127 --> 00:02:56,561
Hello, Dick. How are things?

46
00:02:56,607 --> 00:02:59,724
- Fine. All set for tomorrow?
- The competition?

47
00:02:59,767 --> 00:03:03,646
- What have you planned?
- Ah. I shouldn't say.

48
00:03:03,687 --> 00:03:06,247
- Mother Teresa.
- No.

49
00:03:06,287 --> 00:03:08,562
I think you have a chance this year.

50
00:03:08,607 --> 00:03:10,916
Oh, well. Do you really?

51
00:03:10,967 --> 00:03:12,923
No!

52
00:03:13,887 --> 00:03:15,161
Who was that, Dick?

53
00:03:15,207 --> 00:03:18,005
Dougal, I'm asking again,
don't go as Elvis.

54
00:03:18,047 --> 00:03:20,800
- What?
- I've been looking forward to this.

55
00:03:20,847 --> 00:03:22,565
I know all the moves.

56
00:03:22,607 --> 00:03:24,643
- Remember who's judging.
- Who?

57
00:03:24,687 --> 00:03:28,999
- Henry Sellers.
- No. He's coming here. Wow!

58
00:03:29,047 --> 00:03:31,959
I told you. Father Dunne
is bringing him over.

59
00:03:32,007 --> 00:03:33,918
I've never met a celebrity.

60
00:03:33,967 --> 00:03:35,923
- You met the Pope.
- Did I?

61
00:03:35,967 --> 00:03:39,039
Don't you remember?
When we were in Rome.

62
00:03:39,087 --> 00:03:43,046
That was the Pope? That fella
living in the art gallery?

63
00:03:43,087 --> 00:03:44,759
The Vatican, Dougal.

64
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:48,277
I wouldn't say he's
a celebrity in the true sense.

65
00:03:48,327 --> 00:03:51,285
The Pope is God's
representative on Earth.

66
00:03:51,327 --> 00:03:52,999
You'd think he'd be taller.

67
00:03:53,047 --> 00:03:55,197
What, like a giant?

68
00:03:55,247 --> 00:03:57,556
Still, Henry Sellers coming here.

69
00:03:57,607 --> 00:03:58,960
(Laughs hysterically)

70
00:03:59,007 --> 00:04:02,716
- Henry Sellers coming here.
- Dougal! Calm down.

71
00:04:02,767 --> 00:04:06,043
We've to concentrate
on the Elvis problem. Look.

72
00:04:06,087 --> 00:04:08,999
We'll toss for it.
Whoever wins can go as Elvis.

73
00:04:09,047 --> 00:04:10,719
Ok. All right.

74
00:04:10,767 --> 00:04:12,962
Right, heads or tails?

75
00:04:15,087 --> 00:04:17,078
Heads. No, tails.

76
00:04:17,127 --> 00:04:18,845
Heads. Tails. Heads.

77
00:04:18,887 --> 00:04:22,436
Dougal you have to give me
a choice between the two.

78
00:04:22,487 --> 00:04:25,001
Sorry about that.
I got a bit excited.

79
00:04:25,047 --> 00:04:27,436
Here we go again. Heads or tails?

80
00:04:27,487 --> 00:04:29,205
- Heads.
- Are you sure?

81
00:04:29,247 --> 00:04:32,319
Absolutely pos... Tails!
Heads. Tails. Heads!

82
00:04:32,367 --> 00:04:36,121
- Dougal. Calm down.
- Heads. Tails. Heads.

83
00:04:36,167 --> 00:04:37,839
Dougal, are you all right?

84
00:04:37,887 --> 00:04:41,277
I'm fine. I'm just not
the best at making decisions.

85
00:04:41,327 --> 00:04:43,522
- Look...
- Or am I?

86
00:04:43,567 --> 00:04:47,719
Tell you what we'll do.
You toss the coin, I'll take heads.

87
00:04:47,767 --> 00:04:49,962
Heads it is. Go ahead, toss it there.

88
00:04:53,007 --> 00:04:56,158
Forget it. Forget it!

89
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:01,686
Yes!

90
00:05:09,647 --> 00:05:11,717
Ted, Henry's on.

91
00:05:11,767 --> 00:05:13,485
Ted.

92
00:05:13,527 --> 00:05:17,361
'Back to you, Monica
for a five-point question.

93
00:05:17,407 --> 00:05:21,958
'The capital of England -
is it New York,

94
00:05:22,007 --> 00:05:23,838
'London...

95
00:05:23,887 --> 00:05:25,559
'or Munich?'

96
00:05:28,407 --> 00:05:31,604
'I'll give you a clue.
You live there.'

97
00:05:34,687 --> 00:05:35,881
(Bell)

98
00:05:35,927 --> 00:05:37,485
'Jane, do you know?'

99
00:05:38,807 --> 00:05:42,243
'I leaned on the button by mistake.'

100
00:05:44,047 --> 00:05:46,083
He's great, isn't he, Ted?

101
00:05:46,127 --> 00:05:50,757
Henry. And he'll be here any second.
Are you excited, Ted?

102
00:05:50,807 --> 00:05:54,436
Henry Sellers. Look at him there,
asking the questions.

103
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:58,366
'..stitch in time saves how many?'

104
00:05:58,407 --> 00:05:59,601
(Bell)

105
00:05:59,647 --> 00:06:01,956
'Oh, sorry.'

106
00:06:04,007 --> 00:06:05,599
'London.'

107
00:06:08,567 --> 00:06:10,683
Any idea why he left the BBC, Ted?

108
00:06:12,767 --> 00:06:15,361
Ah, look, Ted.
Why don't you be Elvis?

109
00:06:15,407 --> 00:06:19,286
Since you thought of it first,
I suppose it's only fair.

110
00:06:19,327 --> 00:06:20,885
I'll go as Mother Teresa.

111
00:06:22,087 --> 00:06:24,601
Oh, I'm sorry, Dougal.

112
00:06:24,647 --> 00:06:28,117
I'm being very selfish.
I'm sorry, you go as Elvis.

113
00:06:28,167 --> 00:06:31,398
No, it's not fair on you.
You had your heart set on it.

114
00:06:31,447 --> 00:06:34,723
- Seriously, you go as Elvis.
- Really? Great! Thanks.

115
00:06:36,407 --> 00:06:39,046
Unless you'd prefer to go
as Mother Teresa.

116
00:06:39,087 --> 00:06:44,002
Ah, no. Anyway, there's only one
Mother Teresa, and that's you, Ted.

117
00:06:48,287 --> 00:06:52,280
Thanks. At least I'll have the honour
of taking care of Mr Sellers.

118
00:06:52,327 --> 00:06:56,479
It's important that we be nice
to him. That'll improve our chances.

119
00:06:56,527 --> 00:06:59,917
We'll fill him with food
till it's coming out his ears.

120
00:06:59,967 --> 00:07:02,527
You'll be nice to him,
won't you, Father?

121
00:07:02,567 --> 00:07:04,717
(Groans )

122
00:07:04,767 --> 00:07:06,758
Father, are you all right?

123
00:07:09,927 --> 00:07:11,565
Oh, no.

124
00:07:11,607 --> 00:07:14,201
Not Toilet Duck again.

125
00:07:17,527 --> 00:07:21,042
You know what that does to you.

126
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:24,284
You'll be seeing
the pink elephants again.

127
00:07:24,327 --> 00:07:26,841
How many fingers am I holding up?

128
00:07:29,687 --> 00:07:30,881
Three.

129
00:07:30,927 --> 00:07:34,397
Hmm. Not too bad. Probably getting
immune to it by now.

130
00:07:34,447 --> 00:07:36,642
- (Doorbell)
- That'll be Henry. God.

131
00:07:36,687 --> 00:07:39,155
He's here.

132
00:07:39,207 --> 00:07:43,325
Hello, there. Henry Sellers.

133
00:07:43,367 --> 00:07:46,086
Father Ted Crilly.
It's an honour, Mr...

134
00:07:46,127 --> 00:07:49,119
And it's lovely to be here, too.

135
00:07:49,167 --> 00:07:51,601
Hello. Father...

136
00:07:51,647 --> 00:07:54,002
Sorry, this is Father Dougal McGuire.

137
00:07:55,167 --> 00:07:57,556
Dougal, say something to Mr Sellers.

138
00:07:57,607 --> 00:07:59,245
How old are you?

139
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:03,366
Dougal! Don't ask
Mr Sellers how old he is.

140
00:08:03,407 --> 00:08:06,205
That's quite all right.
I'm 37, Father.

141
00:08:06,247 --> 00:08:09,523
This is Father Jack Hackett.

142
00:08:09,567 --> 00:08:11,558
Hello, Father.

143
00:08:11,607 --> 00:08:13,677
Hello, Father.

144
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,803
(Screams )

145
00:08:19,687 --> 00:08:21,040
Bye, Father.

146
00:08:21,087 --> 00:08:23,396
- He's just gone for his walk.
- Oh.

147
00:08:23,447 --> 00:08:25,915
Is there anything we can get you?

148
00:08:25,967 --> 00:08:29,198
- Call me Henry.
- (Jack screaming)

149
00:08:29,247 --> 00:08:33,001
If you had something to eat,
maybe a sandwich.

150
00:08:33,047 --> 00:08:35,561
Mrs Doyle, some sandwiches.

151
00:08:35,607 --> 00:08:37,165
Right, Father.

152
00:08:37,207 --> 00:08:39,163
Ahem.

153
00:08:39,207 --> 00:08:40,196
(Laughs )

154
00:08:40,247 --> 00:08:43,364
- Is something wrong with your head?
- Dougal!

155
00:08:43,407 --> 00:08:45,796
What? It's just
his hair looks a bit...

156
00:08:45,847 --> 00:08:48,077
- Dougal.
- I didn't say anything.

157
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:50,516
It's just Henry's hair
looks a bit mad.

158
00:08:50,567 --> 00:08:53,843
Is... Is Father Dunne with you?

159
00:08:53,887 --> 00:08:56,606
Yes. He's just bringing in...
There he is.

160
00:08:56,647 --> 00:08:58,603
Ha, ha, ha! Ted!

161
00:08:58,647 --> 00:09:01,559
Barty. Good to see you.

162
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:02,835
Sit down there.

163
00:09:02,887 --> 00:09:05,037
(Laughing)

164
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:07,476
It's good to be
on Craggy Island again.

165
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:12,162
God, I haven't seen you in ages.

166
00:09:13,247 --> 00:09:15,636
I remember the last time I was here.

167
00:09:18,647 --> 00:09:21,161
We had that funny incident. Remember?

168
00:09:24,567 --> 00:09:28,242
I suppose... I suppose you've
forgotten all about it.

169
00:09:32,407 --> 00:09:34,762
It was the type of thing, you know...

170
00:09:35,847 --> 00:09:37,519
What is this?

171
00:09:37,567 --> 00:09:41,685
The last time Father Dunne was here
Father Jack lost his slippers.

172
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:47,958
It was a bit like...

173
00:09:49,487 --> 00:09:53,241
He had us looking
everywhere for them.

174
00:09:56,327 --> 00:09:59,205
It was a bit like
the type of thing, you know...

175
00:10:00,927 --> 00:10:04,044
- We found them after a while.
- It was a bit like...

176
00:10:05,527 --> 00:10:07,324
Oh, Lord.

177
00:10:07,367 --> 00:10:10,518
- How long was the car journey?
- Four hours.

178
00:10:13,007 --> 00:10:16,761
With the thing there...
I suppose it must be!

179
00:10:16,807 --> 00:10:18,877
What's it like being a TV star?

180
00:10:18,927 --> 00:10:21,964
- Well...
- It must be...

181
00:10:24,367 --> 00:10:26,517
It must be... It must be...

182
00:10:29,807 --> 00:10:33,516
We are delighted to have you.
Is there anything we can get you?

183
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:35,364
No, no. I'm fine.

184
00:10:35,407 --> 00:10:36,965
Some more sandwiches?

185
00:10:37,007 --> 00:10:38,406
No, I... Ooh!

186
00:10:38,447 --> 00:10:42,326
You've brought more in.
No, no. I'm fine.

187
00:10:42,367 --> 00:10:44,119
Absolutely fine. Thank you.

188
00:10:44,167 --> 00:10:46,123
Everything Ok with your hair?

189
00:10:46,167 --> 00:10:48,840
Dougal! Stop talking about
Henry's hair.

190
00:10:48,887 --> 00:10:51,799
I'm sorry, Henry.
Your hair is so natural looking,

191
00:10:51,847 --> 00:10:54,202
Dougal can't stop talking about it.

192
00:10:54,247 --> 00:10:57,364
It really is
a beautiful head of hair.

193
00:10:58,367 --> 00:11:02,155
Anyway, what I was saying was,
anything you want, just ask us.

194
00:11:02,207 --> 00:11:05,279
We can get it for you.
There's no problem there.

195
00:11:05,327 --> 00:11:09,639
Anything you want that would be
at all possible for us to get you,

196
00:11:09,687 --> 00:11:11,962
just ask for it.

197
00:11:12,007 --> 00:11:14,316
And I mean anything.

198
00:11:14,367 --> 00:11:16,835
There's no problem there.
Anything.

199
00:11:16,887 --> 00:11:19,799
I have had trouble
getting the English papers.

200
00:11:19,847 --> 00:11:23,476
- Would it be possible...
- Except the English papers.

201
00:11:23,527 --> 00:11:26,837
Anything else, just ask.
Except the English papers.

202
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:30,163
You wouldn't have the number
of a Father Dick Byrne?

203
00:11:30,207 --> 00:11:32,562
It would be a mistake to visit them.

204
00:11:32,607 --> 00:11:34,677
Why is that, Father?

205
00:11:36,927 --> 00:11:38,997
They're lepers.

206
00:11:39,927 --> 00:11:40,916
What?

207
00:11:40,967 --> 00:11:44,880
The three of them are lepers.
Rugged Island is a leper colony.

208
00:11:46,207 --> 00:11:48,516
Leper colony? You're not serious?

209
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:52,721
No, not leprosy.
But there's something wrong.

210
00:11:52,767 --> 00:11:54,803
Did you never think
how strange it was,

211
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:57,407
three priests living alone
on an island?

212
00:11:57,447 --> 00:11:59,165
I suppose...

213
00:11:59,207 --> 00:12:02,643
Something's not right there.
You're better off with us.

214
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:05,599
Ted, could you tell me
where the old...

215
00:12:05,647 --> 00:12:08,002
You know, the old...

216
00:12:08,047 --> 00:12:11,357
The old...is up the stairs
and first on the left.

217
00:12:11,407 --> 00:12:12,601
Thank you.

218
00:12:14,007 --> 00:12:15,645
It's a wig.

219
00:12:16,807 --> 00:12:18,718
(Bell)

220
00:12:18,767 --> 00:12:21,964
Time for a little nightcap.

221
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:26,603
You're running out of sandwiches.
I'll bring you in some more.

222
00:12:26,647 --> 00:12:28,877
I won't have a sherry, thank you.

223
00:12:28,927 --> 00:12:31,157
Don't be silly. Of course you will.

224
00:12:31,207 --> 00:12:34,404
- No. I shouldn't.
- Go on, it'll help you sleep.

225
00:12:34,447 --> 00:12:36,324
No. You go ahead.

226
00:12:36,367 --> 00:12:39,757
Just a little drop.
Just a teeny tiny bit.

227
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:42,037
The day a little sherry hurts anyone

228
00:12:42,087 --> 00:12:45,796
is the day Ireland doesn't win
the Eurovision Song Contest.

229
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:48,718
- Go on.
- No, I shouldn't.

230
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:52,362
Go on. Go on, go on.

231
00:12:53,407 --> 00:12:55,796
Go on. Go on.

232
00:12:55,847 --> 00:13:00,875
Go on, go on, go on, go on,
go on, go on, go on.

233
00:13:00,927 --> 00:13:02,326
No. Seriously, I...

234
00:13:02,367 --> 00:13:06,440
Go on, go on, go on, go on,
go on, go on, go on,

235
00:13:06,487 --> 00:13:08,557
go on, go on, go on, go on, go on,

236
00:13:08,607 --> 00:13:10,404
GO ON!

237
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:20,841
Oh, what a shower of bastards!

238
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:26,481
Lord, Ted, why did you
give him a drink?

239
00:13:26,527 --> 00:13:28,563
I didn't know this would happen.

240
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:31,565
That's why they sacked him
from that programme.

241
00:13:31,607 --> 00:13:35,282
He's a terrible alcoholic.
He's been on the wagon for a year.

242
00:13:35,327 --> 00:13:37,966
- Oh, God, Ted.
- How was I supposed to know?

243
00:13:38,007 --> 00:13:41,886
Sack me? Sack me!

244
00:13:41,927 --> 00:13:44,885
I made the BBC!

245
00:13:44,927 --> 00:13:46,724
(Sobs )

246
00:13:48,087 --> 00:13:49,964
I made it.

247
00:13:50,487 --> 00:13:53,285
Maybe if you have a rest
you'll feel better.

248
00:13:53,327 --> 00:13:56,558
Get away from me! Priest!

249
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:58,438
I think it's time we got to bed.

250
00:13:59,687 --> 00:14:02,076
Good man. There's never anything on.

251
00:14:02,127 --> 00:14:05,005
- I'll give it a kick myself.
- You want a fight?

252
00:14:05,047 --> 00:14:07,322
I'd love a bit of a scrap but...

253
00:14:07,367 --> 00:14:09,801
- Bloody priests!
- (Laughs )

254
00:14:09,847 --> 00:14:12,680
Bloody sanctimonious scumbags!

255
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:16,276
- Absolutely.
- Made my life a bloody misery.

256
00:14:16,327 --> 00:14:20,366
Sorry about that. Are you sure
you wouldn't like to go to bed?

257
00:14:20,407 --> 00:14:22,523
Maybe we could stay up a bit longer.

258
00:14:22,567 --> 00:14:25,445
I'm fed up with you bastards!

259
00:14:25,487 --> 00:14:29,765
I'm getting out of here.
Don't you try and stop me.

260
00:14:29,807 --> 00:14:31,320
Aaaaaaah!

261
00:14:33,607 --> 00:14:35,598
It's true what they say though,

262
00:14:35,647 --> 00:14:39,560
you should never meet your heroes,
you'll only be disappointed.

263
00:14:43,607 --> 00:14:46,804
Imagine we couldn't get him back.
He'd be like Big Foot,

264
00:14:46,847 --> 00:14:49,566
except he'd be
a BBC television presenter.

265
00:14:49,607 --> 00:14:51,245
Do you see him?

266
00:14:51,287 --> 00:14:53,721
There, by the trees.

267
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:56,924
Got him.

268
00:14:58,287 --> 00:15:00,084
There he is.

269
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:04,445
- Terribly sorry about this.
- No problem.

270
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:08,605
I've been through it before.
Actors, television personalities -

271
00:15:08,647 --> 00:15:12,435
they go off drink and drugs
and come over to places like this.

272
00:15:12,487 --> 00:15:16,082
The solitude can get to them.
What happened to this fella?

273
00:15:16,127 --> 00:15:19,278
He was fine one minute,
then he took a sip of sherry.

274
00:15:19,327 --> 00:15:22,683
Relapse, that's when
they're most dangerous. Ready?

275
00:15:22,727 --> 00:15:25,639
I want you to bang
these together and shout.

276
00:15:25,687 --> 00:15:29,362
That'll scare him out of the woods
so I can get a clear shot.

277
00:15:29,407 --> 00:15:32,205
- You're shooting him?
- Tranquilliser dart.

278
00:15:32,247 --> 00:15:35,239
- It'll put him to sleep.
- It seems a bit extreme.

279
00:15:35,287 --> 00:15:38,324
It's the best way, Father.
Believe me.

280
00:15:38,367 --> 00:15:40,358
You know best.

281
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:44,279
God, this reminds me of Vietnam.

282
00:15:44,327 --> 00:15:47,842
- Were you in Vietnam?
- No, no. You know, the films.

283
00:15:47,887 --> 00:15:49,479
All right. Let's go.

284
00:15:51,567 --> 00:15:53,398
Come on Henry.

285
00:15:53,447 --> 00:15:55,085
Out you come. There.

286
00:15:56,207 --> 00:15:57,435
Got him.

287
00:15:58,047 --> 00:15:59,366
(Gunshot)

288
00:16:00,647 --> 00:16:01,796
It's Jack.

289
00:16:03,647 --> 00:16:07,925
I've got a clear shot of him, Father.
Do you want me to get him?

290
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,764
No. Let him go.

291
00:16:09,807 --> 00:16:12,799
- He'll make his own way back.
- Look at him go.

292
00:16:17,487 --> 00:16:19,523
Beautiful.

293
00:16:19,567 --> 00:16:22,320
Oh, my God. My head.

294
00:16:22,367 --> 00:16:25,325
There you are, Henry,
a nice cup of tea.

295
00:16:25,367 --> 00:16:27,483
What? Oh, my God.

296
00:16:27,527 --> 00:16:30,087
Where am I? What happened last night?

297
00:16:30,127 --> 00:16:32,687
I remember having a sip
of sherry, but...

298
00:16:32,727 --> 00:16:34,206
Nothing to worry about.

299
00:16:34,247 --> 00:16:36,636
I hope I didn't do anything
to embarrass you.

300
00:16:36,687 --> 00:16:38,166
(Giggles )

301
00:16:38,887 --> 00:16:41,959
Dougal! No, you were fine, Henry.

302
00:16:42,007 --> 00:16:43,281
(Phone )

303
00:16:43,327 --> 00:16:46,205
That'll be Father Byrne.
I feel sorry for him,

304
00:16:46,247 --> 00:16:50,559
marooned with those idiots,
and they've nothing in common.

305
00:16:50,607 --> 00:16:52,598
..nothing in common. Hello.

306
00:16:52,647 --> 00:16:55,684
- Hello, Dick.
- Ted, we were talking about you.

307
00:16:55,727 --> 00:16:58,036
- Really?
- Saying you great you were.

308
00:16:58,087 --> 00:17:00,920
- Really?
- No!

309
00:17:00,967 --> 00:17:02,605
Hilarious, Dick.

310
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:05,798
- Are you going to turn up tonight?
- Why wouldn't I?

311
00:17:05,847 --> 00:17:09,806
Well, it might be a little
embarrassing to come last again.

312
00:17:09,847 --> 00:17:13,476
We won't come last,
it's you who'll be coming last.

313
00:17:13,527 --> 00:17:16,963
In fact, I thought we might have
a little bet on tonight.

314
00:17:17,007 --> 00:17:19,282
Put your money
where your mouth is.

315
00:17:19,327 --> 00:17:21,557
What are we talking?
A pound? Two?

316
00:17:23,687 --> 00:17:25,086
Five pounds.

317
00:17:26,487 --> 00:17:27,681
Five pounds?

318
00:17:27,727 --> 00:17:30,161
What's the matter, Dick? You scared?

319
00:17:30,207 --> 00:17:33,597
Of course not. Five pounds it is.
See you tonight.

320
00:17:34,687 --> 00:17:38,521
Well, I'd better go and get meself
cleaned up for tonight.

321
00:17:38,567 --> 00:17:43,118
Brush me teeth... I've a very strange
taste of raw meat in my mouth.

322
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:46,523
- I don't know why.
- Right you are, Henry.

323
00:17:47,807 --> 00:17:51,925
Five pounds, I must be insane.
We haven't a hope in hell.

324
00:17:51,967 --> 00:17:54,083
Why can't we all go as Elvis?

325
00:17:54,127 --> 00:17:56,118
Because we all look the same.

326
00:17:56,167 --> 00:17:58,965
Anyway, Jack'll be in any moment
for his drink.

327

(Glass smashes )

328
00:18:00,407 --> 00:18:02,238
(Jack) Drink!

329
00:18:02,287 --> 00:18:04,437
There he goes, bang on time.

330
00:18:06,767 --> 00:18:09,156
God, Ted. He looks very rough.

331
00:18:09,207 --> 00:18:11,960
We'll have to get him sober
before the contest.

332
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:14,396
No, Dougal. Wait. Leave him.

333
00:18:16,287 --> 00:18:18,517
I have an idea.

Fantastic, Father Harry Coyle there.
You know, he looks a bit like...

341
00:18:50,967 --> 00:18:53,845
He won't mind me telling you
this now...

342
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:59,326
Ah, no. Anyway, Henry,
marks for Father Coyle.

343
00:18:59,367 --> 00:19:03,201
Very good. I'll give him
seven out of ten.

344
00:19:03,247 --> 00:19:04,805
Bastard.

345
00:19:04,847 --> 00:19:06,883
Not bad at all!

346
00:19:06,927 --> 00:19:10,636
Ziggy played guitar.

347
00:19:10,687 --> 00:19:14,202
That means the lads from
Rugged Island are still in the lead

348
00:19:14,247 --> 00:19:16,044
with nine out of ten.

349
00:19:16,087 --> 00:19:19,875
So a big hand for Diana Ross
and two of the Supremes.

(Applause )

351

Don't start celebrating yet.

352
00:19:25,727 --> 00:19:28,082
Remember we've got
one more act to go.

353
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:30,766
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome...
