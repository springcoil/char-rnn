1
00:00:00,767 --> 00:00:02,325
(Silence )

2
00:00:05,727 --> 00:00:07,445
..eck! Arse.

3
00:00:07,487 --> 00:00:10,797
- These do work.
- You're right there, Ted.

4
00:00:10,847 --> 00:00:13,486
Feck! Arse! Feck!

5
00:00:13,527 --> 00:00:15,085
(Silence )

6
00:00:42,807 --> 00:00:44,399
(Helicopter)

7
00:00:46,007 --> 00:00:47,406
(Crash)

8
00:01:09,327 --> 00:01:11,045
(Sighs )

9
00:01:14,167 --> 00:01:15,566
So, you're a nun?

10
00:01:17,607 --> 00:01:20,519
Right, Sister Monica.
I've left your bags in the hall.

11
00:01:20,567 --> 00:01:23,286
I thought you might like
to see the Holy Stone.

12
00:01:23,327 --> 00:01:26,080
- The what?
- The Holy Stone of Clonrichert.

13
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:28,925
- Great!
- One of the holiest rocks in Europe.

14
00:01:28,967 --> 00:01:30,958
You can get souvenir combs.

15
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:34,682
They're fantastic.
I got one last year. They've written,

16
00:01:34,727 --> 00:01:38,003
"I saw the Holy Stone
of Clonrichert."

17
00:01:38,047 --> 00:01:42,245
The Stone is great. We've seen it
I think, about 300 times.

18
00:01:42,287 --> 00:01:44,755
Why not? It would round off
the weekend.

19
00:01:44,807 --> 00:01:47,924
If you thought the ludo night
was exciting...

20
00:01:47,967 --> 00:01:50,356
this'll drive you
right over the edge.

21
00:01:50,407 --> 00:01:52,875
It's all been leading up
to the Holy Stone.

22
00:01:52,927 --> 00:01:55,316
What's so holy about it, Father?

23
00:01:55,367 --> 00:01:56,846
It's a general holiness.

24
00:01:56,887 --> 00:01:59,606
Father Dougal stood beside it
for ten minutes

25
00:01:59,647 --> 00:02:01,763
and got a great sense of serenity.

26
00:02:01,807 --> 00:02:04,526
Yes, I got a great buzz off it.

27
00:02:04,567 --> 00:02:07,127
Why is it called the Holy Stone
of Clonrichert?

28
00:02:07,167 --> 00:02:09,727
I thought Clonrichert
was in Fermanagh.

29
00:02:09,767 --> 00:02:12,884
It is. The Holy Stone was up there.

30
00:02:12,927 --> 00:02:15,157
But it wasn't doing great business.

31
00:02:16,367 --> 00:02:20,758
- So, treat in store for you.
- Wonderful. That'll be wonderful.

32
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,798
I'll just go and freshen up.

33
00:02:28,207 --> 00:02:30,846
She'll be putting on make-up,
I suppose.

34
00:02:32,087 --> 00:02:34,078
Impress the lads, huh?

35
00:02:35,327 --> 00:02:38,319
Ah, no. She's probably
just going to the toilet.

36
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:40,164
Aren't nuns great?

37
00:02:40,207 --> 00:02:43,722
You don't feel as nervous with them
as you do with real women.

38
00:02:46,247 --> 00:02:48,044
You're right there.

39
00:02:48,087 --> 00:02:52,365
I just got the courage to talk to
her, but it's nice having her around.

40
00:02:52,407 --> 00:02:55,524
Gives the place a bit of glamour.

41
00:02:55,567 --> 00:02:57,364
A woman's touch.

42
00:02:58,607 --> 00:03:03,237
Anyway, I'd better go and rouse Jack.
Tell him we're off.

43
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,836
Ted says you were touching him.

44
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:30,163
Father Jack, you all right?
Ready for another day?

45
00:03:30,207 --> 00:03:32,198
I'm off with Sister Monica.

46
00:03:32,247 --> 00:03:35,478
If the milkman calls, the money's
under the statue of our Lord

47
00:03:35,527 --> 00:03:37,597
being embarrassed by the Romans.

48
00:03:37,647 --> 00:03:40,241
Would you like a cup of tea
before I go?

49
00:03:41,207 --> 00:03:42,526
Morning, Father.

50
00:03:42,567 --> 00:03:45,127
(Ted) You won't mind us
leaving you alone

51
00:03:45,167 --> 00:03:48,796
because Dougal got that new video
for you, Reservoir Dogs.

52
00:03:49,847 --> 00:03:53,601
It's probably not as violent
as the ones you usually like,

53
00:03:53,647 --> 00:03:55,603
but sure give it a go.

54
00:03:56,567 --> 00:03:58,000
What are you doing?

55
00:03:58,047 --> 00:04:00,402
- This looks bad.
- What?

56
00:04:00,447 --> 00:04:01,846
He's very drunk.

57
00:04:01,887 --> 00:04:06,005
all night. Where does he hide it?

58
00:04:06,047 --> 00:04:10,882
I haven't seen him this bad since
he disappeared with Sister Imelda.

59
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:14,118
God, yes. The blue nun.

60
00:04:15,767 --> 00:04:19,203
- Oh, no, Ted. Look at this.
- Oh, God.

61
00:04:19,247 --> 00:04:22,762
Hold this. Father, this is very bad.

62
00:04:22,807 --> 00:04:25,958
Do you not remember what
the Windolene did to you?

63
00:04:26,007 --> 00:04:28,077
Father Jack, are you there?

64
00:04:28,127 --> 00:04:31,802
- Ted.
- Imagine the damage polish would do.

65
00:04:31,847 --> 00:04:34,156
- Ted.
- What is it?

66
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:36,323
I'm in tremendous pain, Ted.

67
00:04:37,887 --> 00:04:39,764
- Put it down then.
- Oh.

68
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:43,083
God, Dougal.
Come on, get him under the arms.

69
00:04:43,127 --> 00:04:47,200
Come on, Father. We can't have
Sister Monica seeing you like this.

70
00:04:47,247 --> 00:04:48,839
What's the matter?

71
00:04:48,887 --> 00:04:51,447
There you are.
It's Father Jack's motor.

72
00:04:51,487 --> 00:04:53,796
Takes a while to start
in the morning.

73
00:04:53,847 --> 00:04:56,600
- He doesn't look well.
- (Chuckles ) He's grand.

74
00:04:56,647 --> 00:05:00,162
We're taking him on a trip
to the toilet. Right, Father?

75
00:05:00,207 --> 00:05:03,995
Would you put him down in that chair
and we'll have a look at him.

76
00:05:04,047 --> 00:05:06,083
He doesn't like to be fussed over.

77
00:05:06,127 --> 00:05:08,402
I think you should
let me look at him.

78
00:05:12,167 --> 00:05:14,556
Holy Mother of God, he's dead.

79
00:05:14,607 --> 00:05:16,643
What's the problem there, Sister?

80
00:05:16,687 --> 00:05:21,283
Father Jack is dead!
There's no pulse and he's stone cold.

81
00:05:21,327 --> 00:05:23,761
Come on, Father.
You're not dead, are you?

82
00:05:23,807 --> 00:05:27,197
- He's very definitely dead.
- The joke's over.

83
00:05:27,247 --> 00:05:29,442
He's gone.
You should get help

84
00:05:29,487 --> 00:05:32,206
and Father Dougal
can give the sacraments.

85
00:05:32,247 --> 00:05:34,078
Right, I'll call Dr Sinnott,

86
00:05:34,127 --> 00:05:37,756
but frankly I think you're making
a big fuss about nothing.

87
00:05:48,087 --> 00:05:49,600
The last rites, Father.

88
00:05:49,647 --> 00:05:53,560
Oh, right. Yeah, of course.
Shouldn't we wait for Ted?

89
00:05:53,607 --> 00:05:56,485
There's no need.

90
00:05:56,527 --> 00:05:58,757
No. Himself drank it last week.

91
00:06:00,607 --> 00:06:03,246
You wouldn't like
to do the honours yourself?

92
00:06:03,287 --> 00:06:05,278
- What?
- No, of course not.

93
00:06:05,327 --> 00:06:08,956
I suppose I'm wearing the trousers
as far as this job goes.

94
00:06:10,367 --> 00:06:12,085
Right.

95
00:06:14,887 --> 00:06:18,562
Well, we are gathered here today
to join two people...

96
00:06:19,287 --> 00:06:21,084
Sorry, that's not it.

97
00:06:22,847 --> 00:06:25,884
Well, Father, best of luck.

98
00:06:28,047 --> 00:06:30,038
Oh, of course. There's more.

99
00:06:30,087 --> 00:06:32,237
Sorry I didn't see you off.

100
00:06:32,287 --> 00:06:36,121
Don't know if I should be talking
to you down here or up there.

101
00:06:36,167 --> 00:06:37,520
I'll look up there.

102
00:06:38,647 --> 00:06:40,638
Anyway, you're there now

103
00:06:40,687 --> 00:06:44,999
with our Lord and Stalin and
Bob Marley and the rest of them...

104
00:06:45,047 --> 00:06:47,242
and of course my own parents.

105
00:06:47,287 --> 00:06:51,166
Actually I'd like to take this
opportunity to say hello to them.

106
00:06:51,207 --> 00:06:53,880
Hello, Mammy and, er, Daddy.

107
00:06:53,927 --> 00:06:55,918
Hope they're looking after you.

108
00:06:55,967 --> 00:06:58,322
The Latin, Father.

109
00:06:58,367 --> 00:07:00,244
Oh, right. Yeah.

110
00:07:01,647 --> 00:07:07,483
Totus tuus minimus canus,
costa curta Baggio, Roberto...

111
00:07:10,327 --> 00:07:13,444
- Did you ring the doctor?
- Right. It looks bad.

112
00:07:13,487 --> 00:07:17,082
I called Dr Sinnott, I gave him
the symptoms over the phone

113
00:07:17,127 --> 00:07:19,687
and he said he's probably
dead all right.

114
00:07:19,727 --> 00:07:22,195
The pulse not being there
is bad enough,

115
00:07:22,247 --> 00:07:25,159
but the heart stopping
is the real danger sign.

116
00:07:25,207 --> 00:07:27,641
That happened to my uncle
and he was fine.

117
00:07:27,687 --> 00:07:29,723
His heart stopped? For how long?

118
00:07:29,767 --> 00:07:31,280
Er...a week.

119
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:33,716
A week?
And he was fine afterwards?

120
00:07:33,767 --> 00:07:37,726
Actually, no.
Now I think of it, he died.

121
00:07:46,247 --> 00:07:49,080
I think it's absolutely great to see.

122
00:07:49,127 --> 00:07:52,881
I mean, the level of commitment
amongst the African Church.

123
00:07:52,927 --> 00:07:55,521
You're bringing the faith
to the people.

124
00:07:55,567 --> 00:07:57,478
It's marvellous, isn't it?

125
00:07:57,527 --> 00:08:00,200
Sure I wouldn't know,
I'm from Donegal.

126
00:08:04,767 --> 00:08:07,486
Will you have a sandwich,
Father Cleary?

127
00:08:07,527 --> 00:08:12,078
- No, thanks, Mrs Doyle. I'm fine.
- Have a try. They're diagonal.

128
00:08:12,127 --> 00:08:15,483
So I see. But no thanks, anyway.

129
00:08:15,527 --> 00:08:17,358
Go on. They're only small.

130
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:20,160
- I'm fine.
- Are you sure you won't have one?

131
00:08:20,207 --> 00:08:22,880
No thanks. I ate before I came out.

132
00:08:22,927 --> 00:08:26,317
- I could put one in a bag for later.
- No, don't bother.

133
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:29,006
Here's a little bag
you can bring one home in.

134
00:08:29,047 --> 00:08:31,038
- No, no.
- Here's a bigger bag

135
00:08:31,087 --> 00:08:33,203
- to put the little bag in.
- No.

136
00:08:33,247 --> 00:08:36,000
You can eat it later or now.
Whatever suits.

137
00:08:36,047 --> 00:08:37,605
Oh...

138
00:08:37,647 --> 00:08:39,444
You'll have one now.

139
00:08:40,527 --> 00:08:42,563
Sure, I might as well.

140
00:08:42,607 --> 00:08:44,006
Mrs Doyle.

141
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,842
Father Mackey would like a sandwich.

142
00:08:47,887 --> 00:08:50,685
Father Mackey,
will you have a sandwich?

143
00:08:52,167 --> 00:08:54,556
I'm terribly sorry I'm late, Ted.

144
00:08:54,607 --> 00:08:57,917
The car. The car broke down.

145
00:08:57,967 --> 00:09:00,242
That's all right.
Father Fay, how are you?

146
00:09:00,287 --> 00:09:02,642
(Mumbles )

147
00:09:03,887 --> 00:09:05,479
He is. It was very quick.

148
00:09:05,527 --> 00:09:07,802
(Gibberish)

149
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:09,075
Yes, I suppose so.

150
00:09:09,127 --> 00:09:11,038
Oooo... Ee-ur...?

151
00:09:11,087 --> 00:09:13,647
In New Zealand
and a sister in South Africa.

152
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:19,239
Why him, Ted?
Why is it always the good ones?

153
00:09:19,287 --> 00:09:21,517
You bastard!

154
00:09:22,807 --> 00:09:24,399
Father!

155
00:09:24,447 --> 00:09:27,325
He could've been Pope, Ted.

156
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:31,201
But the fecking Jesuits,
they have it all tied up.

157
00:09:31,247 --> 00:09:33,522
- Yes.
- Imagine, Ted.

158
00:09:33,567 --> 00:09:35,558
A Polish Pope.

159
00:09:35,607 --> 00:09:37,882
It should've been Jack!

160
00:09:37,927 --> 00:09:41,363
But it's not what you know, is it?
It's who you know.

161
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:45,119
It's sad, but look at him.
He looks serene.

162
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:49,638
(Wails) Oh, God! No, no, no!

163
00:09:49,687 --> 00:09:52,520
No! He's dead, Ted.

164
00:09:52,567 --> 00:09:54,637
We'll never see him again.

165
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,915
(Sobs )

166
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:59,516
- We'll see him in the next world.
- Oh, yeah, sure.

167
00:09:59,567 --> 00:10:00,795
(Shouting)

168
00:10:00,847 --> 00:10:03,919
Oh, God. No. Get him down.

169
00:10:03,967 --> 00:10:05,685
Get him down. Get him down.

170
00:10:05,727 --> 00:10:07,797
(Shouting)

171
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:29,758
Feck off.

172
00:10:30,727 --> 00:10:32,604
Gimme lots of drink.

173
00:10:32,647 --> 00:10:34,797
Arse! Feck! Drink!

174
00:10:34,847 --> 00:10:37,998
Feck off. Ted, you big fool.

175
00:10:39,567 --> 00:10:41,046
What are you doing?

176
00:10:41,087 --> 00:10:44,045
You shouldn't be getting up
to this nonsense. Up you get.

177
00:10:44,087 --> 00:10:46,885
We should leave his chair
idle for a while.

178
00:10:46,927 --> 00:10:50,158
Would you look at that.
Completely bald.

179
00:10:50,207 --> 00:10:52,118
Smooth as a baby's behind.

180
00:10:52,167 --> 00:10:53,725
You'd know about that.

181
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:57,647
- What?
- You know, when you baptise them.

182
00:10:57,687 --> 00:11:01,566
Oh. Now, I'm going to give
Sister Monica a lift.

183
00:11:01,607 --> 00:11:04,041
- Down to the boat.
- Thank you, Father.

184
00:11:04,087 --> 00:11:08,638
It's the least we could do. You were
always very good to Father Jack.

185
00:11:08,687 --> 00:11:12,282
Excuse me, Father Crilly,
there's a woman here to see you.

186
00:11:12,327 --> 00:11:15,160
A woman, Mrs Doyle.
I think you mean a nun.

187
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:18,279
Oh, no, no, no, no.
It's a woman all right.

188
00:11:18,327 --> 00:11:21,285
A young woman...with a skirt.

189
00:11:21,327 --> 00:11:23,283
I'll be off then.

190
00:11:25,807 --> 00:11:27,843
- Hello, Father Crilly?
- Yes.

191
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:30,526
I'm from Corless,
Corless and Sweeney.

192
00:11:30,567 --> 00:11:32,319
We're fine for coal, thanks.

193
00:11:32,367 --> 00:11:35,325
No. It's nothing to do with coal.

194
00:11:35,367 --> 00:11:40,157
My name is Laura Sweeney.
This must be Father McGuire.

195
00:11:42,167 --> 00:11:45,637
I think you both better sit down.
I've got a shock for you.

196
00:11:45,687 --> 00:11:49,316
I want to assure you that was
a routine relocation of funds.

197
00:11:49,367 --> 00:11:50,436
No, no.

198
00:11:50,487 --> 00:11:53,923
The money was resting
in my account before...

199
00:11:53,967 --> 00:11:57,323
You don't understand.
This is about Father Hackett.

200
00:11:57,367 --> 00:12:00,279
Please, sit down
and I'll explain everything.

201
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:08,006
It may come as a surprise for you
that Father Hackett left a will.

202
00:12:08,047 --> 00:12:10,197
Did he? What does it say?

203
00:12:10,247 --> 00:12:12,841
Well, if I may...

204
00:12:12,887 --> 00:12:16,197
"I, Father Jack Hackett,
being of sound mind and body..."

205
00:12:19,127 --> 00:12:20,321
Sorry.

206
00:12:21,767 --> 00:12:26,079
"..leave my entire fortune to Father
Ted Crilly and Father Dougal McGuire

207
00:12:26,127 --> 00:12:29,039
"to be distributed equally
amongst them and..."

208
00:12:31,767 --> 00:12:34,725
I'll be off now, then, Father.

209
00:12:36,927 --> 00:12:39,566
I'll make the way
to the boat myself, then.

210
00:12:39,607 --> 00:12:41,404
Yeah, yeah.

211
00:12:42,967 --> 00:12:45,527
- Bye, Fathers.
- Yeah, bye.

212
00:12:46,847 --> 00:12:48,041
Listen, Dougal.

213
00:12:48,087 --> 00:12:50,237
Father Jack left us money.

214
00:12:50,287 --> 00:12:52,676
That's very nice of him. How much?

215
00:12:52,727 --> 00:12:54,240
Ha...

216
00:12:54,287 --> 00:12:57,006
Half... Half a million pounds.

217
00:12:58,047 --> 00:13:00,925
Half a million pounds each!

218
00:13:00,967 --> 00:13:02,764
No, between us.

219
00:13:07,607 --> 00:13:11,395
It's only a quarter
of a million each, Ted. Ted.

220
00:13:11,447 --> 00:13:12,641
Ted?

221
00:13:17,167 --> 00:13:20,921
That's that. It looks like
you're going to be very rich men.

222
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,002
Grand.

223
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:26,245
There's one requirement, which I'm
surprised you didn't discuss.

224
00:13:26,287 --> 00:13:28,642
- Oh?
- When is the funeral again?

225
00:13:28,687 --> 00:13:32,202
Again? We haven't had
the first one yet, so...

226
00:13:32,247 --> 00:13:36,638
No. Sorry, maybe I didn't
make myself clear.

227
00:13:36,687 --> 00:13:39,042
- It's tomorrow morning.
- Right.

228
00:13:39,087 --> 00:13:42,796
You know about Father Hackett's fear
of being buried alive.

229
00:13:42,847 --> 00:13:46,283
There's no chance of that now.
You know... He's dead.

230
00:13:47,567 --> 00:13:50,604
Oh, yes. That's why he wouldn't
do confession.

231
00:13:50,647 --> 00:13:54,799
He didn't like enclosed spaces. But
he also just didn't want to do it.

232
00:13:55,847 --> 00:13:59,442
Strangers telling you their sins.
Who'd be bothered with that?

233
00:13:59,487 --> 00:14:03,321
Well, Father Hackett's fear
was so great,

234
00:14:03,367 --> 00:14:07,883
he stipulated that you two must spend
the night before the burial with him.

235
00:14:07,927 --> 00:14:12,079
Ok. That's the least we can do. We
can discuss it with the solicitor.

236
00:14:13,087 --> 00:14:15,362
No, I am the solicitor.

237
00:14:15,407 --> 00:14:17,363
(Sniggers )

238
00:14:18,807 --> 00:14:20,126
No, you're not.

239
00:14:21,287 --> 00:14:25,678
I'm sorry, I am a senior partner
in Corless, Corless and Sweeney.

240
00:14:25,727 --> 00:14:27,718
Now, come on, now.

241
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:32,680
Just because we're from the island,
you think you can have fun with us.

242
00:14:32,727 --> 00:14:34,046
I assure you...

243
00:14:34,087 --> 00:14:38,239
All right. The big thickos
from the island.

244
00:14:38,287 --> 00:14:41,563
- But we're not as thick as we look.
- No way, Jose.

245
00:14:41,607 --> 00:14:46,158
Wait a second! Why do you think I've
been talking to you all this time?

246
00:14:46,207 --> 00:14:48,198
Look, you're a lovely girl,

247
00:14:48,247 --> 00:14:51,523
but I think we should
talk to the solicitor.

248
00:14:51,567 --> 00:14:53,956
If you're a solicitor,
I'm Boy George.

249
00:14:56,727 --> 00:15:00,083
# karma karma karma karma karma
Chameleon

250
00:15:00,127 --> 00:15:02,277
# You come and go

251
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:04,518
# You come and go

252
00:15:04,567 --> 00:15:07,718
# karma karma karma karma
Chameleon... #

253
00:15:07,767 --> 00:15:09,439
(Ted sighs )

254
00:15:09,487 --> 00:15:12,604
- How's your head, Ted?
- Not too bad.

255
00:15:12,647 --> 00:15:16,765
It's true what they say about
career women. Very aggressive.

256
00:15:16,807 --> 00:15:19,446
- She was very aggressive.
- The language!

257
00:15:19,487 --> 00:15:21,478
You wouldn't hear it from a docker.

258
00:15:21,527 --> 00:15:23,995
You would.
They use very bad language.

259
00:15:24,847 --> 00:15:26,838
"Effing this" and "Effing that".

260
00:15:26,887 --> 00:15:28,843
It was worse. She was saying fu...

261
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:30,878
Now, Dougal!

262
00:15:35,447 --> 00:15:38,803
Who'd have thought Father Jack
had half a million pounds?

263
00:15:38,847 --> 00:15:40,644
He never said a word about it.

264
00:15:40,687 --> 00:15:43,042
Lying in a bank account
all these years.

265
00:15:43,087 --> 00:15:45,317
How did he get it
in the first place?

266
00:15:45,367 --> 00:15:48,518
As far as I understand,
he was just an astute saver.

267
00:15:48,567 --> 00:15:50,683
Tried to avoid giving money
to charity,

268
00:15:50,727 --> 00:15:53,366
he wouldn't wear trousers
during summer,

269
00:15:53,407 --> 00:15:56,240
that saved a couple of bob
in wear and tear.

270
00:15:56,287 --> 00:15:59,643
All sorts of savings
all over the place. It all adds up.

271
00:16:00,847 --> 00:16:04,123
I suppose we only knew him
in his twilight years.

272
00:16:04,167 --> 00:16:06,476
But I think we saw the best of him.

273
00:16:06,527 --> 00:16:09,997
The really lovely man.
True knight of the Church.

274
00:16:10,047 --> 00:16:13,278
Gentle, lovely sense of humour.

275
00:16:13,327 --> 00:16:15,397
Patient, good-natured.

276
00:16:15,447 --> 00:16:17,483
Sorry, Ted. Who's this now?

277
00:16:19,847 --> 00:16:23,078
Who do you think I'd be talking about
at this moment?

278
00:16:23,127 --> 00:16:25,322
I'm not sure.
I didn't catch the start.

279
00:16:26,767 --> 00:16:28,166
Jack, of course.

280
00:16:28,207 --> 00:16:29,765
Oh, right. Yes.

281
00:16:29,807 --> 00:16:31,957
A great priest.

282
00:16:32,887 --> 00:16:35,242
First priest to denounce The Beatles.

283
00:16:35,287 --> 00:16:37,960
- Right.
- He could see what they were up to.

284
00:16:39,287 --> 00:16:41,118
He loved children, of course.

285
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,361
He did, yes.

286
00:16:42,407 --> 00:16:44,398
They were terrified of him, though.

287
00:16:44,447 --> 00:16:46,881
He had that stick
and he'd be waving it.

288
00:16:46,927 --> 00:16:49,157
Maybe they thought he'd hit them.

289
00:16:49,207 --> 00:16:51,437
I heard that when he was teaching

290
00:16:51,487 --> 00:16:53,876
he was a great believer
in discipline.

291
00:16:53,927 --> 00:16:55,997
(Muttering)

292
00:16:58,647 --> 00:17:00,763
Would you say he was a good teacher?

293
00:17:00,807 --> 00:17:04,846
Friend of mine, Father Jimmy
Rannable, studied under him.

294
00:17:04,887 --> 00:17:06,639
He told me once,

295
00:17:06,687 --> 00:17:10,362
no one, no one had such
a huge effect on him as Father Jack.

296
00:17:11,367 --> 00:17:13,961
Jimmy Rannable.
What happened to him?

297
00:17:14,007 --> 00:17:17,636
- Remember the Drumshanbo Massacre?
- Yeah.

298
00:17:17,687 --> 00:17:20,155
- That was him.
- Oh.

299
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:23,802
Another thing about Jack,
he loved a bit of competition.

300
00:17:23,847 --> 00:17:26,042
He'd a great sense of fair play.

301
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:28,476
(Angelic choir)

302
00:17:36,287 --> 00:17:37,845
A great traditionalist.

303
00:17:37,887 --> 00:17:41,516
He didn't agree with the modern
thinking within the Church.

304
00:17:41,567 --> 00:17:44,718
You'll burn for all eternity in hell!

305
00:17:46,127 --> 00:17:48,004
Hell!

306
00:17:49,887 --> 00:17:53,516
Funny, one moment you're here,
the next moment...

307
00:17:54,567 --> 00:17:57,161
"And in the happy no-time
of his sleeping

308
00:17:57,207 --> 00:18:00,085
"Death took him by the heart."

309
00:18:00,127 --> 00:18:04,325
You know, someone once said that life
is but a thin sliver of light

310
00:18:04,367 --> 00:18:06,927
between two immensities of darkness.

311
00:18:06,967 --> 00:18:09,003
Makes you think.

312
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:11,038
Does, Ted.

313
00:18:11,767 --> 00:18:12,961
About what?

314
00:18:14,247 --> 00:18:16,807
About death, Dougal. About death.

315
00:18:16,847 --> 00:18:20,886
That's very morbid. What started you
off thinking about death?

316
00:18:30,927 --> 00:18:34,158
Still, it's good we have
this time with him.

317
00:18:34,207 --> 00:18:38,678
Maybe sometimes we weren't always
as thoughtful as we could have been.

318
00:18:38,727 --> 00:18:41,799
At least now we're able
to have this time with him.

319
00:18:41,847 --> 00:18:44,361
Treat him with the respect
he deserves.

320
00:18:44,407 --> 00:18:46,557
You're right there, Ted.

321
00:18:50,487 --> 00:18:52,603
D'you fancy now a game of charades?

322
00:18:52,647 --> 00:18:56,356
- Yes, I think so!
- Right so, you go first.

323
00:18:56,407 --> 00:18:59,046
Right. I'll start.

324
00:18:59,087 --> 00:19:01,157
I'll give you an easy one.

325
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:02,799
Fishing!

326
00:19:02,847 --> 00:19:04,360
Gone fishing.

327
00:19:04,967 --> 00:19:06,958
Boxing... One-handed boxing.

328
00:19:07,007 --> 00:19:10,238
- It's a film.
- You're not supposed to tell me.

329
00:19:14,447 --> 00:19:15,960
Ok.

330
00:19:16,007 --> 00:19:17,440
Film.

331
00:19:19,447 --> 00:19:23,281
- One film.
- One word.

332
00:19:23,327 --> 00:19:27,036
Come on, Ted. You're making it
a bit too easy for me.

333
00:19:27,087 --> 00:19:29,362
I'm not an idiot, you know.
One-word film.

334
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:31,523
Can't be too many of them.
Salem's Lot.

335
00:19:34,687 --> 00:19:36,279
Tongue. Mouth! Teeth!

336
00:19:36,327 --> 00:19:39,239
Is there a film called Tongue?
Tom Tongue.

337
00:19:39,287 --> 00:19:42,006
Er... Tongue Fish.

338
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:43,480
S-s-s-swim tongue.

339
00:19:43,527 --> 00:19:47,202
Er... Fish!
Attack of the giant killing fish.

340
00:19:47,247 --> 00:19:48,965
Tongue Fish. The Deep.

341
00:19:49,007 --> 00:19:50,804
Piranha. Jaws 2.

342
00:19:52,247 --> 00:19:53,566
Close, then.

343
00:19:53,607 --> 00:19:55,404
Ghostbusters 2!

344
00:19:57,167 --> 00:19:59,362
Superman 2! No.

345
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:01,398
Batman Returns.

346
00:20:01,447 --> 00:20:03,085
You had it, it was Jaws!

347
00:20:03,127 --> 00:20:05,277
No, I had Jaws 2. It's different.

348
00:20:05,327 --> 00:20:07,795
It's very different.
It's a different shark.

349
00:20:12,207 --> 00:20:14,437
Ted, are you still awake?

350
00:20:14,487 --> 00:20:19,083
- Yes, yes.
- Just wanted to ask you a question.

351
00:20:19,127 --> 00:20:21,482
Not again, Dougal.

352
00:20:21,527 --> 00:20:24,917
Look, when a man and a lady
are very much in love...

353
00:20:24,967 --> 00:20:26,605
No!

354
00:20:27,967 --> 00:20:30,162
No, I didn't want to ask that, Ted.

355
00:20:30,207 --> 00:20:33,324
I wanted to ask you,
do you believe in an afterlife?

356
00:20:33,367 --> 00:20:36,404
- Do I what?
- Do you believe in an afterlife?

357
00:20:36,447 --> 00:20:38,438
Dougal, generally speaking,

358
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:42,116
priests tend to have a strong belief
in the afterlife.

359
00:20:42,167 --> 00:20:44,317
I wish I had your faith, Ted.

360
00:20:45,367 --> 00:20:46,641
(Sighs )

361
00:20:46,687 --> 00:20:49,326
Dougal, how did you
get into the Church?

362
00:20:49,367 --> 00:20:52,803
Was it "collect twelve crisp packets
and become a priest"?

363
00:20:56,567 --> 00:20:58,478
Ted?

364
00:20:58,527 --> 00:21:00,961
Dougal, please let me go to sleep.

365
00:21:01,007 --> 00:21:05,717
I was wondering, what are you gonna
do with your share of the money?

366
00:21:05,767 --> 00:21:09,555
Well... Luckily, there are lots
of charity organisations

367
00:21:09,607 --> 00:21:11,518
that are grateful for money.

368
00:21:11,567 --> 00:21:17,915
There's Concern, St Vincent de Paul,
Food for Africa, Help the Aged.

369
00:21:17,967 --> 00:21:20,242
(Disco music)

370
00:21:26,447 --> 00:21:28,722
Maybe a few pounds for Comic Relief.

371
00:21:28,767 --> 00:21:31,759
So, some good will come
from Father Jack's death.

372
00:21:31,807 --> 00:21:34,844
It's hard to believe he's gone,
though, isn't it?

373
00:21:34,887 --> 00:21:37,037
You're right there.

374
00:21:39,487 --> 00:21:41,284
(Snoring)

375
00:21:42,247 --> 00:21:44,203
It's beginning to snow again.

376
00:21:44,247 --> 00:21:46,044
The flakes, silver and dark,

377
00:21:46,087 --> 00:21:48,999
are falling obliquely
against the lamplight.

378
00:21:49,047 --> 00:21:51,800
It's probably snowing
all over the island,

379
00:21:51,847 --> 00:21:55,078
on the central plain,
on the treeless hills,

380
00:21:55,127 --> 00:21:57,402
falling softly upon the graveyards,

381
00:21:57,447 --> 00:21:59,722
upon the crosses and the headstones,

382
00:21:59,767 --> 00:22:01,883
upon all the living

383
00:22:01,927 --> 00:22:04,077
and the dead.

384
00:22:04,127 --> 00:22:06,118
Shut the feck up!

385
00:22:07,167 --> 00:22:08,600
Ted! What's wrong?

386
00:22:08,647 --> 00:22:11,525
Father Jack, did you see
what happened? Ted?

387
00:22:12,687 --> 00:22:15,406
What happened, Father Jack?
Wha... Ooooo!

388
00:22:18,687 --> 00:22:20,006
(Snores )

389
00:22:22,447 --> 00:22:27,999
So, there he is, risen from the dead,
like that fella ET.

390
00:22:31,327 --> 00:22:33,761
There's one thing that confuses me.

391
00:22:33,807 --> 00:22:36,560
- Yes?
- Is Jack dead or what?

392
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:41,080
Apparently not.

393
00:22:41,127 --> 00:22:44,802
The floor polish brought about
all the symptoms of death,

394
00:22:44,847 --> 00:22:49,284
such as no heartbeat, rigor mortis,
decomposition,

395
00:22:49,327 --> 00:22:52,285
but he was lucky,
the effects just wore off him.

396
00:22:52,327 --> 00:22:54,716
It's good to have him back, isn't it?

397
00:22:54,767 --> 00:22:55,916
Mmm.

398
00:22:55,967 --> 00:22:58,481
Who needs half a million pounds,
anyway?

399
00:23:00,607 --> 00:23:03,041
Yes, our life is the spiritual life.

400
00:23:03,087 --> 00:23:04,964
(Disco music)

401
00:23:05,007 --> 00:23:09,637
But to be honest...
I don't like talking about this,

402
00:23:09,687 --> 00:23:11,643
but it's only a matter of time.

403
00:23:11,687 --> 00:23:13,837
I mean, he's not a young man.

404
00:23:13,887 --> 00:23:18,085
And, you know, I suppose,
when he's gone it won't be so bad.

405
00:23:19,407 --> 00:23:21,796
The money will be some comfort to us.

406
00:23:21,847 --> 00:23:23,439
That's something.

407
00:23:23,487 --> 00:23:25,921
Now, you'd better come to the shops.

408
00:23:25,967 --> 00:23:29,039
I want to buy some more floor polish.

409
00:23:29,087 --> 00:23:33,239
Maybe we should get a few different
brands, just to try them out, like.

410
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:36,085
Yes, we could leave them
all round the house.

411
00:23:36,127 --> 00:23:40,325
Or we could leave them in Jack's room
and ask him to keep an eye on them.

412
00:23:42,607 --> 00:23:44,245
Drink!

413
00:23:47,767 --> 00:23:48,995
Feck off!

414
00:24:19,247 --> 00:24:21,044
(Disco music)

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
